## Project plan

### Project description

We will utilise the network and contacts built up by the Hebridean Connections project to identify people who may benefit from training in basic digital skills. At least 20 training events will then be held throughout Lewis and Harris, with a particular emphasis on reaching out to remote rural communities.


## Project updates 

August 2015
 
Since the start of the project 27 training sessions in digital skills have been delivered to a total of 74 people. These 74 are people who have not engaged with Hebridean Connections before. Of these sessions 10 were delivered in Uist & Barra reaching 30 people, and 17 in Uist & Harris reaching 44 people.

These sessions can be broken down into 4 different levels:
Level 1 - aimed at those who have never used a computer before 
Level 2 - have or have used a computer/device but need speciic advice such as how to set it up
Level 3 - Basic Digital Skills training as per definition
Level 4 - More advanced IT skills training often on particular software such as Excel or Photoshop

There have been 4 sessions delivered at Level 1, 1 at Level 2, 19 at Level 3 and 3 at Level 4. Going forward the focus will be on Level 3 sessions as this is where most of the interest lies. Ongoing work will continue to be done at Level 1 as these sessions can develop an interest in using a computer and learning digital skills. 

We have found that people tend to want specific advice on specific things, and that there is greater demand for smaller and 1-1 sessions. Because of this demand we are moving away from group sessions to smaller sessions and more 1-1 support. However there will still be bigger groups reached out to at Level 1 such as at Social Clubs.

Of the 27 sessions 8 of them were delivered either completely or partly in gaelic. Some of the older people are more comfortable interacting in gaelic. There are still some senior citizens groups across which are held entirely in gaelic. It's important to have this provision as those who prefer to speak in gaelic might be put off from learning digital skills if the sessions were only delivered in English. 

## Evaluation

This is where the project lead will share information about what was achieved and what was learned.
