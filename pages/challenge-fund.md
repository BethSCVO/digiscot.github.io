We're pleased to announce that we have £300,000, topped up to £325,000 through the kind support of BT Scotland, to support a third round of community digital participation projects across Scotland through the Digital Participation Challenge Fund. 

The projects that we're supporting will enable groups and organisations to digitise content, build digital networks and improve the digital skills of their members, so that they can continue to thrive in the digital world.

Applications are now being accepted, so if you work for or know an organisation that's helping to develop the basic digital skills of its customers or its own staff then we look forward to reading your application.

  <li>To help us paint more of a picture of skills across Scotland, sucessful projects will be required to ask the individuals they're supporting to fill out a short questionnaire on <a href="/about/basic-digital-skills/">Basic Digital Skills</a> and you'll be asked to update us on the progress of the project via your project page, just like <a href="/projects/comas">Comas have done</a></li>
