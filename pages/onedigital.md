We at the One Digital team we have been awarded £500k from the Big Lottery Fund to better understand how to make a significant and sustainable improvement in the [Basic Digital Skills](http://www.go-on.co.uk/get-involved/basic-digital-skills/) of the people most in need.

This activity is part of a wider £2 million digital skills programme [One Digital](http://www.go-on.co.uk/get-involved/basic-digital-skills/), which has been developed by a consortium of organisations including SCVO, Digital Unite, Age UK and Citizens Online. Our projects will benefit people with disabilities and accessibility needs, young adults seeking work, over 65s and charities and the people they support, so that they are able to access essential online services, search and apply for jobs and stay in touch with friends and family.

Each of the partners will run a project which will equip trusted intermediaries to act as ‘Digital Champions’, able to support a wide range of people to develop their Basic Digital Skills.  The Digital Champions will, for example, demonstrate the use of Skype to an older person to help them stay in touch with grandchildren and family or provide a young person with the skills to search for work and complete an online CV.

In Scotland we want to use the project to understand the most effective way to increase the Basic Digital Skills of the third sector, and the people charities and voluntary organisations support. One Digital Scotland is therefore a test and learn project, and we will try the following three different approaches:

<strong>Stream One:</strong>
With the help of an ‘anchor’ organisation we will identify ten organisations in each local authority area to participate in face-to-face and online training. This will aim to improve the Basic Digital Skills of the staff and volunteers in the organisation. These participants will form a network of ‘Digital Champions’ and receive support from our Development officers to identify areas for improvement for delivering changes in their organisation.  
For example, someone who volunteers with a befriending project might decide to set up a Facebook group to offer peer support to the other volunteer befrienders.  
 
<strong>Stream Two:</strong>
With the help of an ‘anchor’ organisation we will identify staff/volunteers with good digital skills from ten different organisations in each local authority area. These participants will be supported through face-to-face and online training, to pass their skills onto the people they are already working with. These participants will also join the ‘Digital Champions’ network and receive support to help their organisation pass on basic digital skills to their end users. 
For example, an employment support worker might decide to routinely support clients to set up a Linkedin profile.     
 
<strong>Stream Three:</strong> 
This stream will support Senior Staff and Trustees who are keen to change the way their organisation responds to the gap in Basic Digital Skills of their staff, volunteers and end users. One Digital will fund two action learning sets to meet on a monthly basis over the course of the project, and support Senior Leaders to tackle the complex strategic and operational challenges that they face together. 

<strong>New Developments- December 2015:</strong>
Over the last 2 months our One Digital team has been taking shape. Development Officers: Maddie and Eilidh have begun making contact with Third Sector Interfaces (TSIs) across Scotland to discuss the local need and challenges as well as learning about the digital work already taking place. Our Project manager Beth has only recently arrived but is busy at the helm of our One Digital Project and has got us up and running.
