#### Beth Murphy, One Digital Project Manager, SCVO

The One Digital project is all about Basic Digital Skills. In Scotland 800,000 adults and 20,000 third sector organisations don’t have basic digital skills.
Since February the One Digital team have visited ten different local authority areas to deliver training. 

•	Making Digital Work – helping organisations to use digital more effectively

•	Making Digital Everyday – helping frontline staff to pass on digital skills to their end users

If you have been on one of these courses we hope you found it useful and you are now starting to work on your action plan. 

We have also been rolling out Action Learning Sets for Senior Leaders. Find out more about the [Action Learning process](http://www.scvo.org.uk/blog/rare-opportunity-to-digitally-transform-your-charity/) and the [response we received](http://www.scvo.org.uk/blog/making-digital-leaders/) when we advertised this opportunity.
