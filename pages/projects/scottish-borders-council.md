## Project plan

### Project description

‘Tea and Tablet’ is an introduction to IT which will equip learners with basic IT skills and knowledge of how to browse the web safely and use the web learn how to use the internet to benefit their day to day lives (for example, sending emails, applying for jobs, keep in touch with relatives and friends etc). Tea and Tablet will be delivered by a CLD tutor four times during 2015/16 in 6 week blocks. The tablets and smartboard can also be used by other community groups using Philiphaugh Community Centre.


## Project milestones

After some difficulties in starting Tea and Tablet, the equipment has been purchased and the programme is now up and running. 
On Monday afternoons, a group of six adults have been meeting to learn the basics of using a laptop as well as a tablet.  The motivation for the individuals in the group to learn about IT and how to use a laptop/tablet, is staying in touch with family and friends and being able to access a wide range of information inclduing whats on locally.  Many had never used a computer before and although some have tablets they are not confident about using them.   The 14th is the last session with this group then we will evaluate with them to find out what their learning has been and what impact this learning will have on their day to day lives.

Here are some of the group participants trying out our tablets for the first time.  The learners really enjoyed using the tablets and learning about the different settings.  They have all said they feel more confident about using the internet and would like to continue using the internet at home.

The next Tea and Tablet group will start in February 2016.

Another group have nearly finished the Tea and Tablet course.  They have really enjoyed learning how to get online using a tablet.  We are now talking with one of the local libraries to discuss how we can support learners to access the next level of IT suppport once they have completed the Tea and Tablet programme.
