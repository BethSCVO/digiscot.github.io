We signed the charter because we know that people sometimes need extra confidence to access the internet, and that a friendly support network as well as experienced and qualified tutors is vital. 
We offer FREE 'Get to know the Interenet session' in Tain, as well as a centre with WiFi, where local individuals and organisations can come to get help and support.
