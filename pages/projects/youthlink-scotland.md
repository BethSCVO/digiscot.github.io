## Project plan

### Project description

This project is part of and will be informed by a broader piece of work developing training on the Digitally Agile National Principles in a partnership between College Development Network, Glasgow Kelvin College, YouthLink Scotland, Learning Link Scotland and the Scottish Community Development Centre (SCDC), convened as a short life working group. This partnership will develop a training course and will assign certain elements to YouthLink Scotland to work with young people and youth workers to inform and develop.

YouthLink Scotland will facilitate consultative workshops with young people and youth workers to develop elements of the training that young people and the youth work sector can make the stongest contribution to.


## Project milestones

**Workshops with Young People and Youth Workers**

Run consultative workshops with young people and youth workers to inform training. August - October 2015
These workshops were delivered with young people and youth workers from Glasgow Kelvin College's Youth Access Project. The young people who attended were aged between 11 and 17. Four sessions were delivered by YouthLink Scotland with some additional preparation and follow up time by Youth Access.

The workshops involved discussion with young people about what the most used social media platforms are and what they used the different plaforms for. We looked at which platforms are most suitable for use within a youth work or community learning and development setting and encouraged the young people to come up with their own ideas about how to use digital tools or social media platforms within youth work. They had some fantastic ideas about using web based research within projects and developing bespoke platforms for the youth work sector and pitched these to a Dragons' Den.

We looked at the key issues that young people faced when navigating the online aspects of their lives. The young people came up with quite an extensive list of concerns and considerations. We discussed which were the most important areas for youth workers to be able to support young people with and they identified their top priorities as:

- Online Bullying - its significance alongside physical bullying.

- Privacy and online reputation - the importance of young people making informed decisions about whether to share something publicly and an understanding that to 'post' is actually to 'publish'.

- Terms and conditions - young people need help understanding and recognising the significance of the terms they are signing up to on social platforms for example ownership and copyright issues surrounding content uploaded onto sites.


Considering the skills, qualities and knowledge that youth workers might need to support young people with these issues the young people developed a presentation about online bullying to include in the Digitally Agile National Principles Training Course.

**Writing training** 

November 2015 - January 2016

Training was developed and course was planned to include one day of face to face training followed by four weeks of online learning.
The content was sourced from resources relevant to the Digitally Agile National Principles, digital skills training courses and informed by the consultation sessions with young people and youth workers as well as learning from other networks and projects that the partners are involved with. The writing was led by YouthLink Scotland in partnership with Glasgow Kelvin College, Learning Link Scotland and the Scottish Community Development Centre. This blended learning approach was a new experience for YouthLink Scotland.

The online learning section of the course would be delivered with training materials available on the [Digitally Agile CLD website](http://www.digitallyagilecld.org/#!training-resources/c8t7) and group discussion and trainer input on [i-develop](http://www.i-develop-cld.org.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=420), the online continuing professional development platform for Community Learning and Development (CLD). Each week's materials and questions would focus on two or more of the Digitally Agile National Principles and would be released to the particpants. Participants would then engage with the materials, try things out in practice and contribute to the group discussion in their own time.

Glasgow Kelvin College offered to support certification for the training course - a Certificate in Digital Planning.
In order to obtain certification participants will be required to contribute to the group discussions, try using digital tools in their practice and complete a Self-Assessment and Action Planning tool, looking at their organisation's practice against the Digitally Agile National Principles.


**Delivering pilot course**

January - March 2016

Face to face sessions were delivered in January:

- Glasgow - 20th January

- Aberdeen - 21st January

- Edinburgh - 29th January


The course was extremely popular: the Glasgow and Edinburgh sessions attracted waiting lists with the Glasgow course being sold out after 2 days of publicity and the Edinburgh session after 4 days. The high demand for training in this field among CLD practitioners is an important learning point from the project.

The face to face training days were delivered by representatives from YouthLink Scotland, Glasgow Kelvin College, Scottish Community Development Centre and Learning Link Scotland. (2-3 trainers per day)

During the face to face sessions we explored the different social media that practitioners already use and spent some time investigating new tools and considering how they could enhance practice.

We had opportunities to share practice and hear from colleagues:

We explored the ethical considerations and professional boundaries surrounding CLD practitioners' use of and engagement with social media and digital technology.

And we identified the role of CLD practitioners as digital participation champions and the onus o us to help break down the barriers that those we work with may face in access and engagement with the internet and the increasing need to be able to function online.
