## Delivery of short courses in digital skills to two groups of people aged 65+ in a Community Housing environment

### Project description
Our small project is supporting two groups of people aged 65+ who live in Retirement Housing in Dornoch and Tain to learn relevant digital skills for communication, broadening their interests, networks and generally enhancing their lives by taking them on a digital journey where they move from paper to getting online using our tried and tested Getting Digital course. The courses are being delivered for us by the excellent Lucy Hawkins.
