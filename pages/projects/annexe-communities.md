### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

1. One to one tuition
2. Keeping the class all focused on the same piece of equipment
3. Keeping the classes short - concentration time improved

Things that we would do differently next time:

1. Make the classes smaller
2. Make one class per piece of equipment ie.specifically Ipads or E-mail
