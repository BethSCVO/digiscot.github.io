### Project description

The project will aim to build a sustainable network of digitally agile older people in Inverclyde who can carry on the legacy of the project using a co-production approach. The project will provide contextualised digital support for learners based around three themes which we know through experience and listening surveys are attractive to older and disabled learners as well as Employment Support Allowance (ESA) claimants in Inverclyde: 
•	Local History 
•	Family History 
•	Digital Photography 

For ESA claimants these courses are attractive option as often learners lack confidence to attend employability programmes or more formal learning due to the level of challenge and pace. These courses allow learners to build their skills and confidence in a non-formal setting. It will serve to reduce social isolation. 

The project will be framed in four distinct sections. 

Stage One – Recruitment and Engagement 
•	Recruitment of staff for the project 
•	Building on existing partnerships 
•	Creating new partnerships as necessary 
•	Engagement of new learners through partnerships 
•	Engagement of new learners through CLD Outreach and Engagement team 
•	Engagement of new learners through ESA team at Jobcentreplus 

Stage Two – Building Basic ICT Skills of learners through 6 week 2hr per week course 
•	Tuition on computer basics -mouse, keyboard and computer navigation 
•	Tuition on using a search engine to find the information they need 
•	Tuition on bookmarking useful websites and storing data on device or cloud 
•	Tuition on keeping in touch using emails, instant messaging and social media 

Stage Three – Progression to 6 week 2hr per week contextualised provision on Local History, Family History and Digital Photography 
•	Tuition on using using a search engine to gain accurate sources of support 
•	Tuition on using internet forums for their course 
•	Tuition on internet security 
•	Tuition on storing data 
•	Tuition on creating and sharing data 
•	Tuition on copyright and protecting content 

Stage Four – Progression on to self-sustaining/co-production groups, volunteering or other learning opportunities. 
•	Groups will have the option to continue their learning as an independent group using a co-production model with CLD. This model involves the group becoming a constituted group who run the group with support from CLD. The group works towards a structure of learning that does not require a paid CLD Tutor such as peer learning, group projects and special guest speakers. Support for this will be under taken in partnership with CLD core service and the on-going support post project will be covered by CLD. 
•	Individuals from the project will have the opportunity to share their skills in their community through volunteering. CLD will run a volunteer training programme and support the volunteers throughout their time volunteering in the short to long term. Support for this will be under taken in partnership with CLD core service and the on-going support post project will be cover
