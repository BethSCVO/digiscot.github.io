## Project plan

### Project description

Castle Douglas Community IT Centre will deliver training on using tablet devices to older people who currently have no access to the internet at home and don’t already own an internet enabled device. Delivery of this project will have two strands - a weekly 2 hour session for 4 weeks supplemented with supported practice or refresher sessions as required. Course content will include basic tablet control skills, accessing the internet, accessing online services (public and private sector) sending/receiving emails, video calling and social networking sessions targeted at improving communication with others. Participants will be provided with a tablet device to use at home for the duration of their course and signposted to local wireless ‘hotspots’ where they will be able to access the internet for free or at a low cost. Participants will learn how technology can bring them closer to friends and relatives, engage with hobbies and interests and access information online.

### Phase 3 - July 2015 - August 2015 

We started our first android tablet classes in Castle Douglas on Tuesday 7th July at the IT Centre. The classes ran for four weeks until Tuesday 28th July from 10.00am – 12 noon.   All five people who attended enjoyed trying out their new tablets and learning the basics first which then allowed them to move onto surfing the net, emailing, shopping online and learning how to contact friends and family on Skype.

Session 1 – We went over all the buttons and controls of the Hudl 2 tablets as well as showed them how to use the stand. We then set each of the members up with a Google account and password which provided them each with an email Address for Google mail. We showed each of them the basic controls and gestures which could use with a Hudl 2 so once they took them home they could get the best out of them. Finally we explained how to connect to Wi-Fi in other locations and at  local hotspots so they could try it out without being here. 

Session 2 – Once we began the second session, we did a recap of the basic controls and gestures. We then began to focus on how they could send and receive emails. We also explained how they would be able to reply to an email which they currently had. Afterwards we showed them how to create a contact so that they could make emailing friends and family much easier. Finally we set them each up with a Skype account and explained all the features and what they could do with it. 

Session 3 – Between week two and three, we sent each of the members of the class an email to see if they would reply and how they got on. When they arrived we briefly went over how to use emails and Skype once again and then we moved onto how to use the internet. They were shown how to use Google Chrome and search for web pages as well as how to close them once they were finished with them. After this we showed them how to use the Google Store and how to install and delete apps. We used the BBC iPlayer and the BBC radio apps so they could do it for themselves as well as be able to use the apps once they left.

Session 4 – On the final week, we did a back-up of each Hudl so if the client decided to buy a Hudl of their own, they would then be able to set it up with ease and continue where they left off.  After that, we showed them how to use the Google voice control as well as how they could use the youtube app to watch videos on any topic of their choice. 
The final thing we did was go over how they could compare broadband prices and explained how they would go about buying it. We then said if they bought their own Hudl, we would happily set it up for them for free. 
Two out of the five have now purchased android devices which we have helped to set up.

Our second batch of classes using iPads also started on Tuesday 7th July at The IT Centre in Castle Douglas and ran from 1.30 – 3.30, for four weeks until Tuesday 28th July.  We had four participants for the afternoon classes who all enjoyed trying out their new devices.  Participants were shown the basics and then moved on to a variety of different things which included searching the internet for the news and weather, emailing friends and family and talking to them on Skype.  Some participants were interested in finding out about catch up tv, listening to music and playing solitaire.

Session 1 – First, we went over the physical features of the iPad. This included the screen, front and back cameras and all the buttons. They were also shown that if they wish, they can mute the iPad or lock its rotation. We then showed them to use the case as a stand and then we switched the iPads on. From there we set the clients up with an Apple ID and a password. By doing this we also set up an iCloud email address for them to use. Once they had been set up, we showed them how to open 
apps, how to swipe and how to scroll. Finally we showed them how to connect to the Wi-Fi at local hotspots. 

Session 2 – On the second week, we gave them a recap on the controls and gestures of the iPad. Afterwards, we showed them how to send and receive an email so they could contact each other. We also explained how they could simply reply to an email which could make it easier for them. After this we explained how they could create a contact on their iPad so they could send emails to people easily and quickly. Lastly we showed them how to use the Facetime and Messages apps as well as gave them information on Skype incase they wished to use it at a future date. 

Session 3 – Between week two and three, we sent each of the members of the class an email to see if they would reply and how they got on. When they arrived we went over briefly how use emails and Skype once again and then we moved onto how to use the internet. We showed them how to use the Safari app to go online so that they could search for whatever they wished. We also explained how to close web pages they no longer needed. Afterwards we showed them how to install and delete apps using the app store. We use the BBC iPlayer app and the BBC Radio app to demonstrate these which would also allow them to use these apps once they left. 

Session 4 – On the last week, we showed them all how to back-up their iPads to the cloud so if they bought their own iPad in the future, they would then be able to use their Apple accounts to continue where they left off. We then went on to show them how to use Siri to make things much easier on the iPad as well as how to use the Youtube app to search and watch videos of their choice. 

The final thing we did was we went over how they could compare broadband prices and explained how they would go about buying it. We then said if they went and bought their own iPad, we would happily set it up for them for free. 

Three out of the four have expressed an interest in purchasing an iPad.

Our third session of android tablet classes started in Dalbeattie on Thursday 30th July – 20th August, from 10.30am – 12.30 held at the Dalbeattie Initiative.  Three people attended and very much enjoyed the sessions. In fact so much so that they have now purchased android tablets and are now on facebook and enjoying keeping in touch with friends and family.
