Enjoyed meeting Project Leaders & SCVO staff at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall 21 April for project management training.  An inspiring start to our Project.  

Marketing drive in momentum.  Posters and leaflets looking good. Liaising with Taigh Ceilidh Day Care Centre today in Kinlochbervie and meeting some of the elderly clients to raise the project profile and inspire interest.  First client booked in for next Tuesday for support on using a tablet and a group session booked in for Wednesday 13 May.  Creative Writers also invited to join up for sessions on 18 May and 15 June at the Training Centre to learn more about digitising their work and inspiration for writing. 

Project is gaining momentum with some fantastic work by our creative writers well on their way to creating their first publication for our project.  Elderly learners have also enjoyed afternoon sessions at the local Day Care Centre for basic ICT skills.  We take a break now for the summer holidays but are looking ahead to more digital learning in August.  Here is a picture of some our Creative Writers in action having just received their new USB sticks for saving their work!

Since August everyone has been working really hard. Weekly basic ICT sessions at the Kinlochbervie Day Care Centre offering support with new tablets, smartphones, photo-scanning, e-mail, online shopping and basic wordprocessing has proved really successful and made using ICT less scary and more accessible.  Members of the Day Care Centre were keen to provide old photos for scanning for an 'end of term' slideshow presentation quiz which was very well received.  Meanwhile the Creative Writers have been extremely industrious and got their collection of short stories, poems and selected photos into print learning new ICT skills along the way for this purpose.  

In September the Day Care Centre Committee were pleased to see the printers proof copies of the Our Stories Your Memories booklet and here they are

A recording to CD was also made of a selection of the stories by way of promotion and for those with sight impairments. You can access this recording online at our website http://northwesttrainingcentre.weebly.com on the Our Stories Project page.

The Our Stories and Your Memories book is currently being sent out to elderly and isolated members of the North West Sutherland Community but here are some members of the community already enjoying the fruits of this great project.

## Evaluation
The project was very rewarding to both ICT learners and recipients of the booklet & CD alike.  Using a photo theme to engage older learners proved popular however, the time involved in many of the activities with older learners was much longer than anticipated especially getting the booklet and CD into production.  We will shortly be fully appraising the passage of the project.
