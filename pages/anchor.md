We’re delighted that you’re considering becoming or have already committed to being a One Digital Project anchor organisation.  It’s a vital role to help us to deliver and improve Basic Digital Skills across Scotland’s third sector.  Below are some frequently asked questions and answers to help inform your decision and to deliver your role. 

<strong>What does the Project aim to do?</strong>
One Digital is aiming to develop the Basic Digital Skills of third sector organisations through Digital Champions.  We are a 'test and learn' initiative, and are offering two types of training and support:

<strong>Stream Two:</strong>
With the help of an ‘anchor’ organisation we will identify staff/volunteers with good digital skills from 10 different organisations in each local authority area. These participants will be supported through face-to-face and online training, to then pass their skills on to the people they are already working with. These participants will also join the ‘Digital Champion’ network and receive support to help their organisation pass on basic digital skills to their end users. 

For example, an employment support worker might decide to routinely support clients to set up a LinkedIn profile.     
 

<strong>Stream Three:</strong> 
This stream will support Senior Staff and Trustees who are keen to change the way their organisation responds to gaps in the Basic Digital Skills of their staff, volunteers and end users. One Digital will fund two action learning sets to meet on a monthly basis over the course of the project and support Senior Leaders to tackle the complex strategic and operational challenges that they face together.
