## Introduction

Scotland is already a digital nation. Eight in ten households have an internet connection, and four in ten have a tablet computer. Six in ten people use a smartphone. For those who have the access, motivation and skills to get things done online, life is enhanced.

But still far too many people risk being left behind. 11% of the adult population in Scotland have never used the internet and almost one in five do not have the [basic digital skills](/about/basic-digital-skills/) to use it effectively.

If this were just a case of missing out on a few distracting websites and celebrity tweets then we might think nothing more of it. But the stakes are so much higher. Amongst other things, the internet helps people keep in touch, learn new things, save money, find work and stay healthy. For some people it&#39;s been a genuine life saver. These things matter to everyone, and they should be for everyone.

Getting people online and developing basic digital skills in Scotland&#39;s communities is key to tackling inequalities and [building a fairer Scotland](https://fairer.scot/).

Over the past two years, the Digital Participation Challenge Fund has [supported 84 projects](/projects/) across Scotland to get people online and develop basic digital skills.

Supported by the Scottish Government, the new Digital Participation Charter Fund is now open for applications. There is a particular focus for the Fund to support organisations currently working to tackle poverty, social isolation and other forms of inequality to embed basic digital skill development work into their day-to-day activity with service users.

## Context

We&#39;re working with the definition of [basic digital skills](/about/basic-digital-skills/) developed by Go ON UK. This highlights five key skills with a safety element underpinning them:
- Communicating
- Transacting
- Managing Info
- Problem Solving
- Creating

Basic digital skills are the starting point on a pathway and identify the foundations that everyone needs to be able to use the internet effectively. Building these skills across Scotland&#39;s communities has the potential to make a significant contributing in tackling exclusion and inequality.

[Recent research](http://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/carnegieuktrust/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2016/09/v3-2697-CUKT-Digital-Participation-summary.pdf) by the Carnegie UK Trust provides evidence on why this is important, noting that many of the groups who are currently digitally excluded could benefit disproportionality from the benefits of being online. The research recognises that while the internet and digital technology is a great enabling and empowering force, if individuals do not have the relevant access, confidence or skills, it has the potential to further exacerbate existing, deep-rooted inequalities.

The recently published Scottish Government [Fairer Scotland Action Plan](http://www.fairer.scot) also highlights the contribution digital participation can make in tackling the &#39;poverty premium&#39;. This is shorthand for the fact that lower income households often have to pay higher prices for basic necessities like gas, electricity and banking than better-off families.

A priority action within the Plan is to ensure _&quot;that low-income consumers have access to the goods and services that enable them to avoid the poverty premium, such as affordable internet access and the digital skills and confidence to transact online to facilitate switching.&quot;_

The Digital Participation Charter Fund is aiming to support organisations to contribute to building basic digital skills as part of broader work to tackle issues of poverty and inequality.

## Learning to be considered

In developing applications for the Fund, it is important that organisations build on evidence around digital participation and lessons learned from previous projects:
- Those without basic digital skills are more likely to be older, on lower incomes and facing other forms of inequality. Applicants should therefore clearly focus on tackling exclusion and highlight the inequalities facing current client groups.
- Half of those that don&#39;t have basic digital skills want to acquire them. The other half can be convinced, but the key is finding a &#39;hook&#39;. This needs to be about understanding how the internet can help support personal interests and passions of individuals. Previous &#39;hooks&#39; have ranged from history to crafts to tropical fish. Applicants should articulate whether they are focusing on those who do want to acquire skills and/or how they will stimulate the interest and motivation for individuals to develop basic digital skills
- Access to internet connections and devices are an important part of digital participation. However, the motivation to go online, understanding of its benefits and the skills to do so are often more significant issues than access. Therefore, while some support may be available for connectivity and devices, the focus should be on building confidence and skills.
- More low-income households now are accessing the internet by smartphones only, potentially without fixed line broadband connections. Evidence shows that smartphones can help people get online, but only enable people to access a limited range of the benefits of the internet. Smartphone-only users still need access to other devices and support to develop basic digital skills. We would welcome some applications which explored this issue in more detail, building on [recent Ofcom research](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/telecoms-research/smartphone-by-default-2016).  We are specifically looking to support a small number of projects which can generate further evidence on the extent to which mobile-only internet use can contribute to the development of basic digital skills.
- The delivery of direct basic digital skills training activity, delivered by dedicated paid members of staff or volunteers, has cost between £50 and £300 per person supported. The higher end costs have been where an individual has complex requirements to enable them to get online.  Some of the most successful and sustainable interventions have been where digital skills motivation and support is embedded within core activity. We would particularly welcome applications which focus on embedding digital skills through in core activity through this &#39;digital champion&#39; approach to ensure sustainability of activity.

Additional learning from previous Challenge Fund projects, which may be relevant, includes:
- People needed a greater number of shorter sessions to develop their basic digital skills, rather than shorter, more intense training.
- People needed more 1-2-1 support than originally envisaged in project applications.
- More people had their own devices than originally thought, but did not have the skills to use them.
- Everyone learning on the same type of device was often more productive than methods using different devices.
- For some projects, overcoming basic literacy and language barriers took longer than anticipated, before tackling basic digital skills.
- Choosing the right type of device to fit the activity is crucial. For example, only desktops or laptops are suitable for developing transactional skills (e.g. form filling).
- Some learners emerged as peer volunteers or supporters and this enhanced success significantly.

## Funding criteria

The following criteria are essential and projects must meet them to be considered for funding:
- Projects aim to [build basic digital skills](/about/basic-digital-skills/) of people who are older, on lower incomes or facing other forms of inequality.
- Priority will be given to projects which can demonstrate a track record of working with individuals who are facing issues such as poverty, social isolation and other forms of inequality. Previous experience of delivering digital skills training is not necessary.
- Priority will also be given to applications who aim to embed the promotion and development of those skills in the organisations day-to-day activity.
- Awards will typically range from £500 to £10,000; applications for more than this will only be considered in exceptional circumstances.
- Successful organisations must have already joined [Scotland&#39;s Digital Participation Charter](http://charter.scvo.org.uk) or commit to doing so.
- To help us understand what the project has achieved and what lessons others can learn, successful projects will be required to:
  - Ask the individuals they&#39;re supporting to fill out a short questionnaire to gauge their [basic digital skills](/about/basic-digital-skills/).
  - Provide regular progress updates by posting content to your project page (here&#39;s [an example](/projects/comas/)).

Applications are unlikely to be considered which:
- Are primarily for equipment, capital expenditure, website development or similar types of organisational infrastructure
- Relate to higher level digital skills (e.g. coding clubs)
- Are aimed at children and young people, unless clear evidence is provided on a specific target group&#39;s lack of [basic digital skills](/about/basic-digital-skills/)
