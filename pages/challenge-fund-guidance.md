####Can I save my application?

Absolutely, you will be asked to create a user account when you start your application form and you can then save your progress and come back to it at a later date if its too much for one sitting.
 
####Who is eligible to apply?
  
The Challenge Fund is open to groups and organisations from all sectors. We are particularly interested in supporting groups that work closely with their local community. Applicants must operate in Scotland, with awarded funds being spent entirely in Scotland.  

####Are there any preferred target groups?

There are several key target groups that we are specifically looking to target through the Challenge Fund Round 3, these are:
<ul>
  <li>Older people</li>
  <li>Disabled people</li>
  <li>Ethnic minority groups</li>
  <li>Those seeking benefits</li>
  <li>Remote and rural areas</li>
  <li>Glasgow focus</li>	
</ul>

However, we will consider applications for projects that support other groups but these are our priorty targets.

####Can I submit an application in partnership with another organisation?

Of course.  We love seeing organisations working together so please feel free to submit a partnership application.  The only thing we ask is that one of the organisations is specified as the lead for the duration of the project; they will be the contract holder and take responsibility for the award.
  
####Can we submit more than one application?
Yes, we will accept more than one application form where several discrete support activities are being proposed and they are not dependent on one another.

####How will my application be assessed?

After the deadline has passed, all applications will be allocated to a member of the assessing group made up of members of the SCVO team; a random group of these will then be selected for peer review.  We will then hold a meeting where all of the projects / applications deemed suitable will be discussed and a final set of recommended projects will be agreed upon.  The team's recommendations are then sent to the [SCVO Leadership Group](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/about/board/) where they will either approve them or ask for further clarifications or considerations to be given.  We aim to announce our final decisions on **12th October 2015**.
