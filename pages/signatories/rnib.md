Technology is the single biggest driver for the increase of independence and inclusion of people with sensory loss and it's vital we help people make the most of advances so no one is left behind.  We want people with sensory loss to fully appreciate and enjoy the benefits of being online and have access to the same opportunities as everyone else.  Online Today is a new Big Lottery funded project led by RNIB, delivered in partnership, to help people across the UK to get online.  Anyone who wants to know more about the Online Today project can contact us on onlinetodayscotland@rnib.org.uk or phone 0131 657 8204.
