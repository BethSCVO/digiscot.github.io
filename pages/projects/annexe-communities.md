Digital Inclusion Classes at the Annexe being delivered by LUMA IT.  
Skills increased, knowledge improved, awareness raised of new technologies!
All going well
Volunteer has been invaluable, helping individuals once the tutor has gone over the basics and perhaps moving to one-to-one work with another individual.  Keeping everyone busy and enabling the tutor to work with particular people on specific skills, or explaining how things work in a manner they can grasp.  Sometimes just a little help is enough to get people off and running again.  
Individuals on these blocks have been mostly absolute beginners, so setting up an e-mail address has been one of the targeted outcomes for most members.

### Phase 3 - July & August

The next group of classes 6th August
Classes kicked off with reduced numbers to enable the tutor to give more one to one support for people attending.
4 week blocks enables people to come, learn the skills with their own piece of equipment, take it home and practice.
Then we start another block with different people and the last lot are busy at home practicing their skills.
If they hit problems or need more, they come back for some more sessions!
Most people only need a few pointers and they're away again.
New approach seems to be working well.
Naturally people help each other but notably, people don't want to come forward as "volunteers"
Inevitably in each group there are one or two who have grasped the ideas and are able to help others.
This continues outwit the classes when people are now meeting up and talking over lunch, using Wi-Fi hotspots to bring their tablets, kindles etc. to share thoughts and discuss new found skills!

### Phase 4 - September & October

When blocks begin, it's decided what to learn on the first week.  Drawn from the needs of the group, a flexible timetable is made encompassing their needs.  Week 2 Facebook, Week 3 e-mails, Week 4 online shopping etc.
This time there is more in depth looks at Facebook, including timelines, friends, likes, groups etc as most members already have a Facebook page set up!
A projector screen enables the tutor to access their own page, showing the workings of the application for the students to navigate around their own pages.
We are specifically looking for peer volunteers to come forward, so at the moment, working to identify and work with building confidence in their own skills to help them along the way.



### Phase 5 - November & December

Deliver final digital skills courses 

## Evaluation

This is where the project lead will share information about what was achieved and what was learned.

### Outputs and outcomes

Overall this project X, Y, Z.

In terms of outputs we delivered A, B and C.

In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has P, Q and R. We know this because J, K and L.

### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

1. One to one tuition
2. Keeping the class all focused on the same piece of equipment
3. Keeping the classes short - concentration time improved

Things that we would do differently next time:

1. Make the classes smaller
2. Make one class per piece of equipment ie.specifically Ipads or E-mail
