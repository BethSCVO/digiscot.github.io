## Upcoming events

### Let’s Get Online campaign launch

About one in six people in Scotland currently don’t access the internet. For many, being online could help reduce isolation, improve quality of life and enable them to access hobbies, education and opportunities.

This summer the **Scottish Government** will launch its **Let’s Get Online** digital participation campaign across the country. The campaign’s centrepiece is a roadshow providing free, informal one-to-one sessions to help people get online, build their confidence and explore how the internet could help in their daily lives. The roadshow will run from late May until July 2016 and is covering the whole of Scotland. The sessions will take place locally in public spaces such as shopping centres, supermarkets or community centres. 

The campaign will also have television and local press advertising, PR and partnership outreach work, and a website providing dates, venues and information about local resources, as well as tools and exercises to help people build their online skills and confidence.

The Let's Get Online website will be launched in **May**. In the meantime if you want to help spread the word, have a great case study to share or just want to ask a question, contact the Let’s Get Online Team: simon.ebbett@gov.scot or Caroline.Cairns@union.co.uk
