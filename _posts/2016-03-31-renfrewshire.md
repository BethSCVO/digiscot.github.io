#### Jennifer Watson (Volunteer Services Co-ordinator) & Abigail Peters (volunteer), Jewish Care Scotland

I am the Co-ordinator of Volunteer Services at Jewish care Scotland. We run weekday day care clubs for seniors living within our community. These clubs are run by staff with the support of volunteers.

I came along with another volunteer to the One Digital Workshop, hoping to gain an understanding of how we can make better use of basic computer skills within our daycentre.

Our task now is to pass that information to our volunteers using our own workshops, who will then in turn be able to offer guidance to clients attending the clubs.

We enjoyed meeting other volunteers and hearing how they use I.T. with their service users and the benefits they have experienced as a result. We were able to share lots of handy hints, tips, websites etc.

The most important learning I gained from the day, was the need for internet safety with respect to personal information.   Attention was also drawn to how people understand and process information and that we donâ€™t all learn things in the same way.

We run a variety of clubs at the day centre e.g. Arts and crafts, Culture Club, Discussion Groups.  Our service users do sometimes ask for help with computer skills but we mainly use Skype, Google, YouTube etc. and use the internet to look up images, information and resources.  We have recently secured funding for I.T. which we are hoping use to buy a few tablets to use within the day centre. The internet is now such an important and useful tool for lots of reasons. 

We enjoyed taking part in the workshop; it was very motivational and informative.  With the information given on the day and the online support offered, we should be more than able to make up a presentation for our volunteers.

Many thanks for this opportunity.

Jennifer Watson and Abigail Peters, Jewish Care Scotland.
