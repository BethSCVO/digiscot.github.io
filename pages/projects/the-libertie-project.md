## Project plan

### Project description

The Creative Digital Club (CDC) will be a project that uses creative digital activities as a platform to engage with hard to reach individuals, develops skills, positive activities, encourages independence and resilience and nurtures individuals to take steps towards developing new interests, training, education or employment.



## Project Milestones

### Phase 1

Plan delivery of digital creative club, establish links with stakeholders and obtain equipment.

We've been shopping for all our new digital equipment and have teamed up with Citizens Online to run a Digital Champions Course. Our first four week course starts next Tuesday and we're already oversubscribed. 

# Update June 24 2015

Our first Digital Champions Course is done, we had 8 people through and everyone got something from it. One of our participants said "I've never used a tablet before....I thought it was just for gaming" and "this is amazing, how can I help others get online?" Famous words and phrases so far "Oh that's what that thingy button does" and "What? You can even do that on Google?"

We had such great feedback and an appetite from people for wanting to learn more and tell all their mates about it we decided to run a Digital Champions Train the Trainer course. That's just finished and we now have 3 Digital Champion Trainers available and oh my goodness, it's making such a difference already. We've identified that "Digital Life Skills" are essential but that for our client group, access to digital equipment to get online is as much of an issue.

So, onto phase 2 we go. We've recruited 2 digital volunteers and we're just about to take on our own premises and set up a digital cafe. More information to follow so watch this space.

### Phase 2

Homeless Club: Deliver digital creative club for people who are homeless.

Establish individual learning plans and record baseline of skills. Deliver pre-employability digital skills and looking for work skills. Create virtual blogs to record progress. Use Digital photography and video equipment to upload to virtual blogs

### Phase 3

Women's Club: Deliver digital creative club for women.

Establish individual learning plans and record baseline of skills. Deliver digital life skills training to include emails, internet searching and shopping, online services. Use digital photography to create virtual webpage and virtual online etsy shop.
