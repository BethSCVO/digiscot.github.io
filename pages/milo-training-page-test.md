#### Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

The quick start guide is intended for users who want to start working with Milo straight away. For a more in-depth, step-by-step guide, please see the individual modules for each section of the database:

* 01 Getting Started
* 02 Organisations
* 03 Contacts
* 04 Volunteer Registrations and PLacements
* 05 Volunteering Opportunities and Placements
* 06 Interactions
* 07 Memberships
* 08 Dashboards
* 09 Tasks and Events
* 10 Reporting

This module will allow you to get logged in and using the system.

For the most part, Milo 2 uses the same data types (organisations, contacts, opportunities) as the original Milo system, so once you become accustomed to the new user interface, it should be fairly straightforward to navigate around the system as before.

#### Logging in <a name="Logging in"></a>

All Milo users require a named licence. If you do not have a licence, please contact your local milo lead to find out if one has already been assigned to you.

When you are set up on the system as a user, you will reveive an automated e-mail with details of how to log in and a URL. You must create your own password on first-time login. DOn't worry - it is possible to reset passwords in the event you forget them. 

To access Milo, go to <a href="https://login.salesforce.com/">https://login.salesforce.com/</a> and enter your details.

#### First steps and features <a name="first steps"></a>

**The home screen**

On login, you will be taken to your home screen - this is where you can see an overview of recent activity, live tasks and events, and any dashboards you have set up. You will see that along the top left of the screen there are several tabs relating to different Milo entities (highlighted below):

**Important features**

There are some helpful and time-saving features (numbered above) available for use throughout the system - it's important to be aware of them before you get started, as they **will** save you some time!

**1. Search**

![Search](images/milo training/search_00.png)

One of the key differences in the new system is that there is now a global system-wide search. The search field is a bit like Googling within Milo – enter any organisation or contact name to find matching results and associations. If you want to use partial words, remember to add an asterisk [*] as a wildcard.

**2. Create new**

![Create new](images/milo training/new_00.png)

Create new allows you to create a new organisation, contact, opportunity, event or task without going anywhere else in the system (though of course, you should always make sure a record for a new contact etc. doesn’t exist yet!).

**3. Recent items**

![Recent items](images/milo training/recent_00.png)

This list will be blank the first time you log in. but as you investigate the system and open more records, your recent history will appear here – very useful for clicking back into a record you were working on earlier in the day without having to search.

**4. Recycle bin**

Lastly, if you accidentally delete a record, fear not – there’s now a recycle bin so you can view and restore recently-deleted items if necessary.
