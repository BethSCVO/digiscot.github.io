#### Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

Milo holds information about all different types of organisations e.g.:

* Voluntary Organisations
* Statutory Organisations
* Private Companies
* Partnership/Networks
* Educational establishments

These are managed using the **Organisations** object in Milo.

For an Organisation, Milo provides a wide range of fields in which data can be recorded. It also allows a number of **locations** to be linked to the Organisation, where an organisation has a number of offices, shops etc. It also allows **contacts** to be linked to an organisation, holding details of the role and the location at which they work.

Organisation records are the heart of the system. Most other parts of the system interact with organisations in some way, including contacts, volunteer opportunities, interactions and memberships.
