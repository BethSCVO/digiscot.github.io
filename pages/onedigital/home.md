## What is One Digital?

The One Digital project at SCVO has been working in partnership with organisations from across Scotland to help improve [Basic Digital Skills](http://www.go-on.co.uk/get-involved/basic-digital-skills/).

<br>For lots of organisations digital is an enabler â€“ tools and technologies can help to communicate with clients, increase donations and deliver services in new and innovative ways. 

For other organisations digital is a solution to help reduce inequalities, and improve quality of life for the people they support. Young people are supported to understand their digital footprint and increase employability. Isolated adults are able to access peer support and feel part of a community when face to face services are closed. 

These videos tell the stories of a few of the people and organisations we have worked with:
