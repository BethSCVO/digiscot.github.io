In 2014-15, supported by the [Scottish Government](http://www.gov.scot) and the ERDF, we awarded more than £300,000 to community digital participation projects across Scotland. These projects have enabled groups and organisations to digitise content, build digital networks and improve the digital skills of their members, so that they can continue to thrive in the digital world.
 
Now we want to do it all again!

In addition to being supported by Scottish Government, we're pleased to announce that the Challenge Fund Round 3 has also been kindly supported by BT Scotland.

###Key Criteria

The Challenge Fund is designed to support a broad range of exciting projects across Scotland however we do have some key criteria so please have a read before submitting an application.

<ul>
  <li>The project must be focussed on developing the <a href="/about/basic-digital-skills/">Basic Digital Skills</a> of the organisation's staff or the people they're supporting</li>
  <li>We have six key focus groups that will recieve a greater weighting in the assessment stage (please note that we are unlikely to fund projects that are aimed at children):
    <ul>
      <li>Older people</li>
      <li>Disabled people</li>
      <li>Ethnic minority groups</li>
      <li>Remote and rural communities</li>
      <li>People seeking benefits</li>
      <li>Glasgow focus</li>
    </ul>
  </li> 
  <li>Awards will range from £100 - £10,000.  Awards of over £10,000 will only be considered in exceptional circumstances</li>
  <li>To help us paint more of a picture of skills across Scotland, sucessful projects will be required to ask the individuals they're supporting to fill out a short questionnaire on <a href="/about/basic-digital-skills/">Basic Digital Skills</a> and you'll be asked to update us on the progress of the project via your project page, just like <a href="/projects/comas">Comas have done</a></li>
</ul>

We are also working closely with organisations that have signed [Scotland's Digital Participation Charter](/charter/) to identify additional in-kind support (e.g. donations of equipment and volunteers). You can note your interest in this kind of support by ticking the box at the end of the application form.
