Letâ€™s Get Digital, supported by the [Scottish Government](http://www.gov.scot) and the ERDF, is a business growth programme for charities and voluntary organisations. It's an opportunity to tap into knowledge, expertise and enthusiasm to boost business growth and competitiveness in the third sector, and to increase digital skills and capability.

It works by helping organisations to set up and finance a six-week or twelve-week paid internship, built around a bespoke project to deliver meaningful digital change and growth. The sorts of projects in scope include:

- Website creation or refresh
- Social media (beginner or advanced)
- E-commerce and online fundraising
- Campaigning, relationship management and digital marketing
- Mobile working
- IT strategy or policy development
- Basic online skills

It's also a great way to give young people the opportunity to gain valuable work experience in the third sector.

Host organisations and interns will also benefit from the support of carefully selected mentors from the Scottish technology sector, who will be there every step of the way to help ensure the best outcomes for both parties.
