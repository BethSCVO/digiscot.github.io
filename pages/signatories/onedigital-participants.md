## How is One Digital different?

We’re delighted that you’re thinking of joining the One Digital Programme. There's lots of digital participation work taking place across Scotland and your organisation may already have benefited from this... <strong>so how is One Digital different?</strong>

One Digital is aiming to develop the [Basic Digital Skills](https://goon-uk-prod.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Basic-Digital-Skills-Framework-FINAL.pdf) of third sector organisations by training <strong>Digital Champions</strong>. There are two types of support available, which we'll entail below, and you can choose which is most relevant to you.

One Digital aims to create a model of continuous Basic Digital Skills sharing that will reach far and wide across the sector, which will be driven from within and will help to improve your services in the long-term.

## What training and support is available?

      <p class="list-group-item-text"><strong>Content:</strong> This training and ongoing support will help you make a difference to the way your organisation uses digital to deliver its mission.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="list-group-item">
      <p class="list-group-item-text"><strong>Example:</strong> A befriending project recognise the isolation that their clients experience. They want to improve the service by setting up an online community offering peer support.</p>

    <span class="list-group-item">
      <p class="list-group-item-text"><strong>Who should join?</strong> This is for you if you want to make a change to your organisation and have a basic understanding of how digital will help. Please check that your organisation will support you to make these changes.</p>

  <div class="panel-heading"><strong>Option 2. Making Digital Everyday</strong></div>
  <div class="list-group">
    <span class="list-group-item">
      <p class="list-group-item-text"><strong>Content:</strong> This training will help you pass on Basic Digital Skills to your clients/ end-users through everyday interactions.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="list-group-item">
      <p class="list-group-item-text"><strong>Example</strong> A support group for people with MS wants to help users book GP appointments but the users show no interest. This training could mean that staff learn new techniques to hel users see the benefits of the internet and change their behaviour.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="list-group-item">
      <p class="list-group-item-text"><strong>Who should join?</strong> This is for you if you regularly work with clients and end users and know they would benefit from digital. You should have basic digital skills yourself but you're not expected to be an expert.</p>
    </span>
  </div>

<strong>Both options will involve:</strong>

- One day of face-to-face training (expected to be held from 9.30am- 4.30pm). As part of this training you will develop an action plan for applying your skills to your organisation or with your clients as a Digital Champion.

- You'll then undertake an online module to build on your face-to-face training and have access to a digital community with further support and resources.

As part of both training opportunities we will ask you to complete a short Basic Digital Skills audit about you and your organisation at the start and end of the project. This will allow us to measure how effective the different training approaches have been.

Each organisation must select either <strong>Making Digital Work</strong> or <strong>Making Digital Everyday</strong> to take part in. If you’re unsure which training is best for your organisation please see our criteria for participants below.

## What criteria must participating organisations/participants meet?

<strong>1. Making Digital Work participants must:</strong>

- have an existing level of Basic Digital Skills.
- be in a role within an organisation which allows them to take action following training, e.g. an administrator or development focussed role.

<strong>2. Making Digital Everyday participants must:</strong>

- have an existing level of Basic Digital Skills.
- have a rike as staff and/or volunteers who come into regular contact with clients/end-users.  

<strong>ALL participants must:</strong>

- Have their organisation's permission to take part.
- Have their organisation's support e.g. allowing time to undertake all training and support them effecting their action plan.
 

## How many participants from each organisation can take part?

Once you have selected which training you want your organisation to take part in you can select up to two members of staff and/or volunteers to participate.

We're looking for 10 organisations to take part in <strong>Making Digital Work</strong> and 10 alternative organisations to take part in <strong>Making Digital Everyday</strong>. With each organisation putting up to two participants forward, each training will hold up to 20 participants, allowing you the opportunity to forge great links with a wide range of third sector organisations in your locality.

## How much will it cost to take part?

The One Digital training opportunity is <strong>FREE</strong>!

We'll provide a training venue, refreshments and ongoing resources for free. All we ask in return is your commitment to fully participate- attending training, joining the One Digital network, sharing details of the changes you are effecting with our team over the course of 2016.

## Where and when will training take place?

The training will take place in a venue within your Local Authority area; a central location with good transport links. We'll confirm the exact location of the training venue to all participants as soon as possible.

We'll be rolling out our face-to-face and online training courses between February and May 2016 with ongoing support to follow. The exact dates for training will be announced shortly.
