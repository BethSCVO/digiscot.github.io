## Directory

For many people who want to learn how to do things online, taking the first step is easier if there's someone else around to lend a helping hand. We know it's not always easy to find this sort of support, so we're helping to build a directory of places in Scotland where it's on offer. This includes places you might expect to find support like libraries and computer clubs, and as well as other places like lunch or craft clubs.

To see what's listed in your area, start by entering a postcode.

<form role="form" action="http://letsgeton.digitalscotland.org/Search" method="GET">
  <div class="form-group">
    <input type="text" class="form-control input-lg" id="postcode" name="geo.postcode" placeholder="Enter postcode">
  </div>
  <div class="form-group">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Search</button>
  </div>
</form>

For people who aren't able to search online, the same information is available by calling 0300 004 1000.

The directory supports the Scottish Government's [Let's Get On](http://www.letsgeton.scot/) campaign.
