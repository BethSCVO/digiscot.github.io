## Project plan

### Project description

The Creative Digital Club (CDC) will be a project that uses creative digital activities as a platform to engage with hard to reach individuals, develops skills, positive activities, encourages independence and resilience and nurtures individuals to take steps towards developing new interests, training, education or employment.



## Project Milestones

### Phase 1

Plan delivery of digital creative club, establish links with stakeholders and obtain equipment.

We've been shopping for all our new digital equipment and have teamed up with Citizens Online to run a Digital Champions Course. Our first four week course starts next Tuesday and we're already oversubscribed. 

### Update June 24 2015

Our first Digital Champions Course is done, we had 8 people through and everyone got something from it. One of our participants said "I've never used a tablet before....I thought it was just for gaming" and "this is amazing, how can I help others get online?" Famous words and phrases so far "Oh that's what that thingy button does" and "What? You can even do that on Google?"

We had such great feedback and an appetite from people for wanting to learn more and tell all their mates about it we decided to run a Digital Champions Train the Trainer course. That's just finished and we now have 3 Digital Champion Trainers available and oh my goodness, it's making such a difference already. We've identified that "Digital Life Skills" are essential but that for our client group, access to digital equipment to get online is as much of an issue.

So, onto phase 2 we go. We've recruited 2 digital volunteers and we're just about to take on our own premises and set up a digital cafe. More information to follow so watch this space.

### Phase 2

Homeless Club: Deliver digital creative club for people who are homeless.

Establish individual learning plans and record baseline of skills. Deliver pre-employability digital skills and looking for work skills. Create virtual blogs to record progress. Use Digital photography and video equipment to upload to virtual blogs

### Update June 2015

Skills Development Scotland have been training us to help others use "My World of Work". We're registered as a partner agency on the website which means we can help people use resources like the "My DNA" and "My strengths" sections which we think are excellent pre-employability tools for all ages and abilities. And it's great for building on your digital skills confidence. So far we've helped 9 people to use this site and print off their own "career personality and individual strengths profile"

In our Digital Creative Club for the homeless we've been having fun, from digital photography to having a go at community journalism and making an "oh my goodness it's so bad I can't upload it" digital film recorded on an iphone. With thanks to Citizens Online the group has developed the confidence to produce a weekly "what's on for free" bulletin for Inverness and is available on our facebook page with links to all the events. We've found rubber duck races, lego exhibitions, street parties and zombie rehearsals so far!

### Phase 3

Women's Club: Deliver digital creative club for women.

Establish individual learning plans and record baseline of skills. Deliver digital life skills training to include emails, internet searching and shopping, online services. Use digital photography to create virtual webpage and virtual online etsy shop. 

### Phase 4

Offender's Club: Deliver digital creative club for offenders.

Establish individual learning plans and record baseline of skills.Deliver digital radioskills training to create virtual radio programme. Establish whether Ofcom will grant temporary or restricted internet radio license. Establish budget for running internet radio station beyond the timescale of the digital creative club.
