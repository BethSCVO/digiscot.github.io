title: One digital- Senior Leadership Action Learning 
excerpt: National Movement to close the digital skills gap
permalink: /actionlearning/
---

As part of the new One Digital programme we are seeking applications from senior leaders who want to transform their organisation’s approach to going digital.  


We know that by embracing digital, charities are more likely to see an increase in their funding, and can work more efficiently. However, currently half of all Scottish charities (20,000 organisations) lack basic digital skills- [please see here](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/about/annual-report-2015/)

There are often a number of complex reasons why charities struggle to become more digital, including time, motivation, resourcing and access to training and support.  


The One Digital project will bring together a group of senior third sector leaders who are keen to tackle this issue. Using [action learning methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_learning/) the group will be supported to work together to find solutions to the problems that they are facing.

## Action learning sets

The leaders will meet monthly to tackle real problems or issues. The action learning process promotes curiosity, inquiry, and reflection. There is a requirement that talk be converted into action and, ultimately, a solution. Those taking part in the process should be committed and open to learning. 

The sets will be facilitated by an independent expert, and the space provided will be confidential.  

## What commitment is needed? 

We plan to support two action learning sets, one for CEOs and Directors, and the second for Chairs and Convenors of Trustee boards.  

If you are interested in taking part there will be no charge and your expenses will be met by the project. In return we require you to commit your time to attend seven sets between February and August, four full days with a residential option, and three half days. 

We will ask you to audit the level of digital skills in your organisation at the start and end of the programme, and to share anonymised information about the impact of the learning set. 

## Who should apply? 

We are looking for leaders who represent a cross section of Scotland’s third sector in Scotland. You don’t need to be digitally savvy as an individual as it’s your passion and knowledge about creating a more digital third sector we’re looking to engage. We are seeking leaders who can demonstrate:

## What sorts of challenges? 

A key principle of action learning is that the members will seek solutions to challenges which are real and current.
