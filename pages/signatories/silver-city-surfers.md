Silver City Surfers is a charity in Aberdeen which helps people aged over 55 in the North East of Scotland gain confidence using computers and the Internet.  The charity believes modern technology can reduce loneliness and isolation for older people.  Experienced volunteer tutors share their digital skills with older adults at one-to-one tutoring and support sessions throughout the City of Aberdeen. Hospitality volunteers welcome people and make them feel comfortable at these sessions by offering refreshments.  This is a free service.
