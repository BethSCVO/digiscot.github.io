## Project plan

### Project description

This project will employ a part-time Digital Inclusion Communications Coordinator at our Inclusive Learning Centre. The Coordinator role will include facilitating the ILCâ€™s operation, registering new users and assisting service users in getting the most out of equipment and software. The Coordinator will work alongside the Regeneration Department at WSHA in the creation and continual evaluation of a timetable of activities at the ILC.

The Coordinator will also liaise with key partners and other local service users - particularly existing G31 Centre users - to create sustainable partnerships and encourage further cross-demographic use of the ILC facilities, focusing in particular at engaging the Over 60s tenants, Benefit Seekers and those with mental and physical disabilities. This will be achieved through organising focus groups and holding workshop sessions to identify key needs, and subsequently generating project ideas to meet these needs.


## Project milestones

- April 2015 : Digital Inclusion Coordinator Job listed & open for application
- May 2015   : 2x Lenovo Yoga 2 13.3" netbooks purhcased with first batch of funding. The Lenovo notebooks were selected due to their flexibility - they can act as Laptops or fold into flat Tablets, giving a range of training options for different user-bases.

- 7th July 2015 : Niamh officially started in her post as Digital Inclusion Coordinator
- 7th July 2015 : Niamh was introduced to the G31 Centre Staff and given a full induction to the G31 Learning Centre computer suite.
- 15th July 2015 : Niamh visited Denmilne Gardens Sheltered Complex with Alison Cameron (WSHA's Older Persons Coordinator) to touch base with some of the residents, and to attempt to identifiy avenues through which to engage with Older People. Niamh will attend Denmilne Gardens at the end of a current Arts & Crafts project to introduce some of the community to digital communication.
- 23rd July 2015 : Niamh and Marco visited Dawn McManus from Thenue Housing to learn about how they utilise digital technology to facilitate Community Engagement and Employability programme.

## Evaluation

This is where the project lead will share information about what was achieved and what was learned.

### Outputs and outcomes

Our goal is to increase the number of tenants in disadvantaged communities engaging in digital technology, focusing on the following demographics and milestones:

- Older People: we aim to engage with 200 of our over 60s tenants through our existing Club60 programme, and through liaison with the Sheltered Complexes

- Disabilities: we aim to egage with 100 service users, via the Accord (in G31 Centre), Care UK and The Mungo Foundation (both of whome have facilities in Camlachie)

- Benefit Seekers: currently our partners Jobs & Businesses Glasgow and Glasgow Homelessness Network engage with 20-30 service users at the ILC. We wish to expand this number to 200-250 users over the next year.
