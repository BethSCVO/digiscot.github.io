###Scottish Enteprise supports the Digital Participation Charter.

Scottish Enterprise is primarily concerned with creating sustainable economic growth through support to businesses. 
In common with many Scottish agencies, we take our digital policy lead from Scotlandâ€™s Digital Future. Within this, SE is deeply involved in three of the four strands, 
- transforming our own public services, 
- stimulating the digital economy, 
- and connectivity, where we help stimulate business demand for and uptake of mobile and ultrafast broadband services.

So why have we signed-up to the Digital Participation Charter? 
In taking a rounded look at our contribution to the overall strategy, it becomes clear that none of this will be the best it can be for our businesses without the success of the remaining strand: the digital participation of organisations and individuals. 
- Scotland needs its businesses to be able to use digital technologies knowledgeably and safely in order to maximise market intelligence, productivity and sales. 
- As these technologies become more pervasive, businesses will need their actual or potential customers to have similar digital capabilities. 
- Equally, the future workforce for business will need them as well.
 
The above describes a business-based rationale for supporting universal digital participation: a rationale which is completely aligned with the social rationale for the same objective.
What can we bring? 
- We will continue to increase the digital participation rate amongst businesses. 
- We will ensure our own workforce in Scotland is digitally capable.
- We will share our learning on topics relating to digital participation.
