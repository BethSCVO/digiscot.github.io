## Project plan


### Project description

We will employ a specialised Digital Advisor one day per week to deliver digital inclusion workshops and personalised one-to-one support.  The post-holder will be home-based and responsible for delivering the following activities over 9 months:  6 digital outreach community workshops and work with 40 disabled people learn basic online skills across the Highlands.  The project will: Build IT literacy capacity of people with disabilities through increased digital inclusion and specialised support; Digital inclusivity will lead to disabled people having the opportunity to maintain and cultivate relationships (both professionally and personally), promoting social inclusion and enhanced well-being; Increase disabled clients’ opportunities to access various online tools, such as, completing employment applications, internet banking, online shopping, email, and social networking; Increased self-esteem and confidence in people with disabilities, leading to more people with disabilities becoming digitally engaged and improving their quality of life.

## Project Milestones

We organised a meeting with Cheshire House in order to determine what subjects the clients would be interested
in.  Each client was asked what they would like to achieve and the reasons they wanted to become more proficient in use of the computer.#
We gave them some ideas but also asked for their preferences:
-	Internet safety
-	Basic course of using computers
-	How to use the technology (moving on to how to use it by yourself)
-	How to find things on the internet
-	Want to find educational games (lower the amount of time spent on youtube)
-	How to edit settings on the computer (i.e. increase the font size, change size of the cursor -> looking at it for different versions)
-	How they can use a computer to make art
-	Other Points
-	Additional equipment (chin buttons, arms, magnifying screens)
-	Interested in having volunteers to help with computers
-	
We have included below the numbers interested in the different workshop areas. Unfortunately we won’t be able to combine the workshop currently due to the limited amount of computers and high interest from day services. We are hoping to fix an additional computer that will enable us to run the workshop for five people.

There is definitely a possibility of getting both volunteers and residents involved depending on their availability.

We have arranged to run a workshop on 8th September and will begin with basics such as turning computer on/off and accessing the internet.
We have spoken to Cantraybridge College and have carried out a similar process where have asked for preferences and we will begin with them on 15th September.

8th September 2015
We delivered a workshop at Cheshire House to 5 clients of varying capabilities and after completing an initial assessment form and a permission to use their images we discussed their individual requirements re the workshop and we began with a basic session in how to turn on the computer.  This was followed by information on the different parts of the computer and what they all do.  After starting the computer we looked at the desktop and how to navigate to different places.  The general input was that although several of the clients were able to access programmes such as social network sites they had to be set up by a third party.  We looked at how to access the internet and how to use a search engine and every one, some with assistance was able to access a website of their choice.  The general feedback was that the session had been useful and the clients had benefitted from it.  The session was delivered in a light-hearted manner and this aproach seems to work with this particular client group. We made a decision on our session for the following week and we will be exlaining how to use email.

Had a discussion with Alison at Cantraybridge College to prepare for our first workshop on the 15th September.  We checked all the resources were in place and looked at the room in which we will be delivering the session which contains a smart board and several laptops although some of the students will use their own.  We will be following the programme from Cheshire House but will change any aspects as we progress.
