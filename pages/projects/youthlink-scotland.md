This project is part of and will be informed by a broader piece of work developing training on the Digitally Agile National Principles in a partnership between College Development Network, Glasgow Kelvin College, YouthLink Scotland, Learning Link Scotland and the Scottish Community Development Centre (SCDC), convened as a short life working group. This partnership will develop a training course and will assign certain elements to YouthLink Scotland to work with young people and youth workers to inform and develop.

YouthLink Scotland will facilitate consultative workshops with young people and youth workers to develop elements of the training that young people and the youth work sector can make the stongest contribution to.


## Project milestones

Workshops with Young People and Youth Workers

Run consultative workshops with young people and youth workers to inform training. August - October 2015
These workshops were delivered with young people and youth workers from Glasgow Kelvin College's Youth Access Project. The young people who attended were aged between 11 and 17. Four sessions were delivered by YouthLink Scotland with some additional preparation and follow up time by Youth Access.

The workshops involved discussion with young people about what the most used social media platforms are and what they used the different plaforms for. We looked at which platforms are most suitable for use within a youth work or community learning and development setting and encouraged the young people to come up with their own ideas about how to use digital tools or social media platforms within youth work. They had some fantastic ideas about using web based research within projects and developing bespoke platforms for the youth work sector and pitched these to a Dragons' Den.

We looked at the key issues that young people faced when navigating the online aspects of their lives. The young people came up with quite an extensive list of concerns and considerations. We discussed which were the most important areas for youth workers to be able to support young people with and they identified their top priorities as:
- Online Bullying - its significance alongside physical bullying.
- Privacy and online reputation - the importance of young people making informed decisions about whether to share something publicly and an understanding that to 'post' is actually to 'publish'.
- Terms and conditions - young people need help understanding and recognising the significance of the terms they are signing up to on social platforms for example ownership and copyright issues surrounding content uploaded onto sites.

Considering the skills, qualities and knowledge that youth workers might need to support young people with these issues the young people developed a presentation about online bullying to include in the Digitally Agile National Principles Training Course.
