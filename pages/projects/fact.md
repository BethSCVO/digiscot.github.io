## Project Plan
Over a six month period Forres Area Community Trust (FACT) will develop a digital project called Forres Online, aiming to make being online easy and accessible for those living in the local area.  The project will primarily focus on reaching older members of the community and those seeking employment, helping these individuals get on in life by being online.

In partnership with local organisations, FACT will develop a programme of training for online learning and activity in Forres.  Volunteer tutors will be recruited, trained, and supported to provide sessions for the public during drop in daytime hours and evening sessions.  FACT will provide a fully equipped training room with free WiFi access, laptops, and tablets so that members of the public and volunteers will have a functional space to learn in.

Forres Online will help older members of the community connect with friends and family online, do internet shopping and banking, and access topics of interest and advice where needed reducing isolation and promoting independent living.  Local job seekers and benefit claimants will become better informed about the services they can access via online information and have increased job opportunities from gaining digital skills and submitting accurate online job applications.  Volunteer tutors will develop tutoring skills to enhance their existing skill set contributing to their personal development and wider development of an engaged community.
