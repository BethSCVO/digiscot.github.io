## Project plan

### Project description

People who are isolated and not connected to their community will 'drop in' to UR CIRCLE and recieve social support to make friends in an informal setting within the context of the Community Centre. They will learn to use IT on laptop, iPad or Hudl in an informal manner through conversation and topics which interest them. The project will be facilitated by a part time Project Co-ordinator. 


## Project milestones

These are the milestones we have achieved at the end of July.

a)	We have recruited our co-ordinator and have connected with all our partners to ask for referrals

b)	Attended some networking events to promote UR CIRCLE

c)	Put up posters in the locality

d)	Invited other people who attend the centre groups

e)	The group has been running since beginning of May

f)	Numbers have been slow but have had ten different people attending over the period

g)	People who attend are lonely, isolated and have little or no knowledge of IT.  They have enjoyed the sessions using laptops or hudls
