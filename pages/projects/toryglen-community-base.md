Marketing of service including recruitment of participants.  

**Update**  With no local library and the levels of deprivation higher than the Glasgow average the marketing of the computer suite has been welcomed by many.  Advertising was done through the local housing newsletter, leaflets in shop windows, doctors/dentist surgeries, school gates, etc.  Moreover, a large network was reached by e-mail and facebook as well as attending networking events to promote this facility.




**Update:** Basic and Intermediate IT classes have started and participants are enjoying using the new equipment as well as the new software which has been installed. A Job Club has also been started which is well attended by many who benefit from efficient computers.  Job Centre Plus refer also many people with little or no computer skills in order to receive support with on-line job searches, applications, etc.

**Update**  Currently recruiting (May 15) for a Digital Photography course and in discussions to set up a Community Journalism course.  We are also supporting Toryglen Youth Club to offer a specialised Job Club service to 16 - 19 year olds.

### Phase 3 February - July 2015

Ongoing use of facility to support training, digital skills clubs, job clubs and community access 


**Update:** Our job club who use the computer suite have remarked on the speed of the computers now and how this has helped with their job searches. 

Our computer suite is also open to the public and they too are enjoying the benefits of the new computers. On average there are over 50 members of our community who access the computer suite on a weekly basis.

**Update**  This number will increase as more specialised groups are interested in running IT specialised courses.  WSREC are discussing over 55's BME IT classes and a BME Job club from Toryglen Community Base.  A local "Reminiscence" group also utilises the IT suite when required.  Within the Base, Urban Roots an environmental project use the suite with their volunteers to undertake project work.  Other groups such as First Steps confidence building will use computers to undertake personality testing and Next Steps employability course will use the computers for CV creation and on-line programmes to identify skills and strenghts.
