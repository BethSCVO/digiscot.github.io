I attended SCVOâ€™s first Digital Inclusion training session in Stirling on 24th February 2016.

It was great to hear how technology can help to improve efficiency and connectivity for small Third Sector organisations and to find out that not everything is costly. Many of the really useful suggestions that were flying around the room, from both the attendees and the trainers, were actually free to implement and use.  

The session certainly motivated me to think about how I could do things differently and reduce my time and effort at the same time.All attendees needed to commit to an action plan and mine was to improve the way I communicate and share information with my 56 volunteers.  

On the course I learnt about MailChimp which is free to register and use, for up to 12,000 emails per month.  My plan is to develop an eBulletin for my volunteers which will be distributed via MailChimp on a quarterly basis.  Within Mail Chimp I can add links to the eBulletin for websites that I want to share with my volunteers. Since returning to the office I have also considered how MailChimp could be used to keep communication channels open with the Food Train staff team from branches across Scotland.

All in all a very interesting and useful day with great information sharing from everyone involved.
