Pulsion is one of the signatories on Scotlandâ€™s Digital Participation Charter, a national movement to promote digital participation and basic digital skills in Scotland. Our shared ambition is for Scotland to be a world-leading digital nation by 2020.

As part of the "Let's Get Digital" programme,  Pulsion provides mentoring services to third sector organisations to support them in developing their digital strategies. As well as providing guidance to the organisation, the mentor also supports an intern, employed by the organisation, to help increase their digital skills and expertise. 

Pulsion is hopeful that by being part of this movement, we can give back to our local community and support third sector organisations to embrace digital.
