1st LinkedIn workshop delivered at [Let's Get Sporty](http://letsgetsporty.com/) in Dumfries

"Today made me notice that there is a lot of different choices towards finding a job."
"Interested me in the possibilities and opportunities that using social media correctly can hold."

### Delivery: Workshop 2, April 2015

2nd LinkedIn workshop took place in Glasgow hosted by [PwC](http://www.pwc.co.uk/) 

11 volunteers attended this workshop, 60% of whom had little or no experience of using LinkedIn prior to the workshop.  100% of participants felt they had 'lots' of knowledge post workshop and all told us they would continue to use LinkedIn to help with job searching and networking.

"Just thanks for an interesting afternoon - it's encouraging to see successful people helping the younger generation out, and greatly appreciated."
"Really enjoyed [Jackie Cameron](http://www.consultcameron.com/)'s workshop - her information was presented passionately and will help me when job hunting."
"It was positive and we were given personal and valuable advice."
