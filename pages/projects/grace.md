### Project description

Our aim at G.R.A.C.E is to establish a Digital Well Being Cafe within Hillhead Community Centre from where we currently deliver our services. In recognition of our clients needs and the ongoing societal demands for digital literacy we have urgent need to establish an IT suite through which we can offer supported digital literacy learning workshops to adults who have become socially incapacitated or isolated through traumatic life events, mental health issues, poverty, unemployment & poor socioeconomic placing, and or, addiction related issues. 

The IT suite will be available throughout the working week for members to use and the key aims we need to meet through implementing our Digital Well Being Cafe are to furnish participants with a digital literacy skills foundation that will: 

* Encourage self-directed endeavour utilising digital technologies

* Promote confidence in engaging with digital based social mediums and communities 

* Build and promote confidence in using digital technologies as a way of engaging with others and thereby reduce social isolation and exclusion and promote social capacity 

* Reduce anxiety and promote confident engagement with today’s high tech society with particular focus on understanding and accessing benefits through online government services such as Universal Credit & Job Search

* Enable self-supported problem solving in the use of and engagement with digital technology and the digital world 

* Empower individuals with a sound grasp of terminology and jargon relating to digital technologies and mediums

* Enable greater understanding and communication within the family setting when dealing with digital technology and related mediums, particularly between parent and child 

* Find people better placed to move onto positive destinations in relation to education, training and or employment 

In addition to training on laptops we will explore other technologies such as phones, tablets, midi controllers, cameras etc 

A visiting facilitator Rikki Traynor will conduct digital literacy workshops offering personal tuition and group lead digital based learning activities, Rikki has over two years experience in working with G.R.A.C.E and has the unique attributes that afford him the ability to nurture and support a person on a recovery journey, whilst possessing industry recognised IT skills and an ability to teach such in a way that is appropriate and accessible to all those who engage with G.R.A.C.E.

For G.R.A.C.E it is all about providing services and training which develop people’s ability to prevent themselves from reaching crisis point and relapsing.  This innovative project is not just about individuals developing digital literacy skills, the digital cafe will be implemented to work in tandem with our other projects and services, this project is about empowerment, it is about supporting people as they seek to achieve full independence in life, it is about enabling individuals to play their part in shaping the world that is shaping them.
