### Project description
We’re planning to provide an online shopper service via designated and trained helpers available for 2 hours on a Monday at the same time as our regular computer club (10am-12). The service will be for all tenants eventually but the 6 people identified will ’trial’ it initially. 2 are Club members who we expect will be able to shop online for themselves with minimal support by the end of the project. The other 4 tenants are less able and are less likely to be able to shop online independently longer term but will do so with support. This service will help both Viewpoint and support services to make better use of staff time and resources through the use of the internet as well as helping tenants tap into what is of benefit to them online. We hope that will encourage them to explore other things e.g. Skype, emailing relatives etc. Tap into IT will approach Asda (-whom we note are Digital Charter signatories) and other supermarkets, tenants and their relatives where appropriate to work out a way to minimise any risk of financial abuse to tenants or of putting Tap into IT employees/Volunteers in a vulnerable position e.g. by exploring prepayment cards or other ways of avoiding access to payment card details. This project is intended as a ’pilot’ for a service that can be purchased by Viewpoint and partner agencies and rolled out to tenants in other locations.

### Planned project milestones

* Tap into IT has explored prepayment options with Asda/other online supermarkets and got relevant legal advice and we have clearance from their insurers & ours on the terms & conditions of the service: December 2015

* Tap has met with each of the 6 individual tenants participating agreed terms & conditions of the service: December 2015

* Training of Tap into it sessional worker & Volunteer who’ll be delivering the training/support: January 2016 

* Service starts in January till March on a trial basis, Monday mornings for 2 hours delivered by a Tap into it worker + Volunteer: March 2016

* Review and report back on the project with a view to rolling out the service to at least the 2 other locations with a computer club in 2016: March 2016 

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* 2 tenants able to shop online with minimal support 

* 4 tenants unable to do their own shopping are involved in the process of choosing and ordering their own shopping online on a regular basis 

* Online shopping becomes an attractive alternative option for all 35 tenants at Lynedoch extra care housing and encourages more interest among the 75+ year old age group to get online. 

* New service can be replicated elsewhere with potential to free up Social Care staff and family time for other purposes or clients
