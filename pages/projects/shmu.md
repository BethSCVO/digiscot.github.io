## Project plan

### Project description

Tillydrone Community Portal: The bulk of the project activities will take place from 17th August to 31st October 2015. Some of the activities will continue after the core work has been delivered in terms of supporting the installation, further roll out of the access to the portal, generation of additional content and additional evaluation.  The project will continue to be supported throughout.

**Infrastructure**

The development of the community portal is dependent on the implementation of the wireless network which is part of a different and larger project.  The timeline for the network infrastructure has slipped but is now being progressed with an anticipated installation start during w/b 21st September 2015.   

**Community Engagement**

The involvement of community members in this project will help to inform and direct the activities and ensure that the portal will be developed in a user friendly manner and will contain content which is of interest to the community.  The initial activity will take the form of a stakeholder workshop with community members to share the motivations of the project, facilitate continued participation and shape the ensuing evaluation agenda. Following the initial workshop we will continue to engage with a range of community groups and organisations.
