## Project plan

### Project description

CNS will work with elderly members of the Orkney and Shetland Community to teach them how to use digital technology through the use of the app Fieldtrip GB. People will be able to capture minor place-names and stories attached to specific places in the landscape. The data captured will be uploaded to a website, which will form a lasting legacy and which will also continuously be used to add more data. Participants will also be trained in scanning photographs and uploading other types of material to the project website.


## Project milestones 
Orkney

Milestone 1: Purchase of smart phones and printer/scanner. Advertise the workshop in The Orcadian. Match funding for staff time: Initial meeting with the Orkney Heritage Society on 22 April. Appearance on BBC Radio Orkney, press release for the Orcadian. Contact other local heritage societies and small museums.  Set up ‘skeleton’ website.  Develop questionnaire for EDINA app and test new smart phones.	Marketing using posters to promote our project to the local community in order to spread information about the project and our activities and will gain participants for our workshop and field days. This is all to ensure we are ready to start working on the project by the envisaged start date of May 25. Expected completion date: 4/6/15	

Milestone 2: Workshop held in late May/early June. Community work with participants for Alex Sanmark and Ragnhild Ljosland with data capturing and uploading material to the website. Participants will also be given help with scanning and other digital tasks relating to the project. This is the overall aim of the project and will teach participants to use digital technology. We will also gain ‘community agents’ during this time, who can spread the project further. Expected completion date: 30/9/15

Milestone 3: Mid-way review. CNS will assess the progress of the project at its half-way point, report back to SCVO, and ensure that the project webpage has been kept up to date with project developments. Expected completion date:  July 31st

Milestone 4: Additional work on the website. Collecting and presentation of data captured by community agents and new project participants. Match funding: staff time, IT help and use of CNS accommodation. This work will make sure that the website contains all data captured so far and will give training to new participants or existing ones still in need of help. Expected completion date: 30/9/15

Shetland
 
Milestone 1: Hold initial meeting with Chair of Shetland Heritage Association and discuss project 18th May.  Show her how to use Fieldtrip GB. Send out leaflets to all members of association including local museums and history clubs. Purchase 6 x Hudl2 by 5th June.  Match funding for staff time. Advertise the workshop of 5th June being held at Shetland College on 29th May in The Shetland Times. Give appearance on BBC Radio Shetland and press release for the Shetland Times. Work with Orkney CNS to set up ‘skeleton’ website and develop online map. Develop Shetland version of questionnaire for Fieldtrip GB app and test Hudls. Carry out marketing using posters to promote the project to the local community in order to spread information about the project and our activities and to gain participants for our workshop and field days. The posters will be distributed throughout the learning centres in Shetland. This is will ensure the project will be ready to start of envisaged start date of June 5th. Expected completion date: 4/6/15               
 
Milestone 2: Workshop held on 5th June by Andrew Jennings. Intensive community work in the islands by Andrew Jennings sharing knowledge with elderly participants and showing them how to capture data and upload the material to the website. Participants will also be given help with other digital tasks relating to the project. The overall aim of the project is to teach participants how to use digital technology. The Chair of Shetland Heritage Association will help us gain ‘community agents’ during this time, who will spread the project further, particularly to the outlying areas such as Fair Isle, the north Isles of Unst and Yell, and further to Skerries. Expected completion date: 30/9/15
 
Milestone 3: Mid-way review. CNS will assess the progress of the project at its half-way point, report back to SCVO, and ensure that the project webpage has been kept up to date with project developments. Expected completion date:  July 31st 
 
Milestone 4: Additional work on the website, including developing the map of Orkney and Shetland. Collecting and presentation of data captured by community agents and new project participants from throughout Shetland. Match funding: staff time, IT help and use of CNS accommodation in Shetland College.

During the first days of May Ragnhild Ljosland started the community visits to inform about the project. This time it was North Ronaldsay, the northernmost of the Orkney Islands. The leaflet she brought with her can be seen [here](https://twitter.com/NordicUHI/status/595520414723485697) 

Our Orkney press release is out! Date of the first workshop set to June 6. [See it here](http://www.orkney.uhi.ac.uk/news/orkney-community-digital-heritage-project) We were also interviewed by BBC Radio Orkney about the project and our forthcoming workshop. 

During  early May Andrew met Pat Christie of Shetland Heritage Association and began the process of meeting elderly people in Shetland keen on preserving their heritage. Our Shetland press release is also out! [See it here](http://www.shetland.uhi.ac.uk/news/heritage-to-be-explored-through-smart-technology) Our new Facebook group Shetland Digital Heritage Project is also up and running. Andrew was interviewed by BBC Radio Shetland on 04/06. 
The date of the workshop is also set for June 6. We are going to connect Orkney and Shetland with VC.

Porject update June 17: Milestone 1 has been completed and we are now working towards Milestone 2. The following activities have taken place:  

Update from Orkney. Milestone 1 has been completed and we are now working towards Milestone 2. The following activities have taken place:  

19th May:
Ragnhild Ljosland held a workshop with the Orkney branch of the University of the Third Age (U3A) at the Orkney Library in Kirkwall. This was our first workshop with a group of complete beginners in the sense that most had never used a tablet before, although a handful had prior experience. We discovered the need to go right back to basics, such as how do you switch the tablet on, and the fact that the picture turns when you turn the device. After the workshop, we completely re-wrote the information sheet, to include screetshots with arrows and detailed explanations. We now have two versions: One for the more experienced and one for the complete beginners. Another lesson learned was about group size and mixed ability groups. The U3A group was large: 45 people participated. It was difficult to help everybody at once, especially because they were at very different stages. Having learnt this lesson, we developed a step-by-step approach for the next workshop, in Sanday, where we went through the absolute basics first and then got onto the more advanced option of downloading the app to your own device last once everything else was done. The U3A group did enjoy the workshop, though, and some took Hudls away on loan. You can see a picture [here](https://twitter.com/NordicUHI/status/611093209297481728)

Orkney 3rd June:
Ragnhild Ljosland spent the day in the island of Sanday, where she met with the local Afternoon Club. This is a club for retired people which meets on a Wednesday afternoon in the Sanday Community Centre and invites speakers and activities. The Orkney Community Digital Heritage project made contact and was invited to the Afternoon Club to speak about the project and hold a workshop. 15 Afternoon Club members attended. They were informed about the project aims, and were shown some of the records which have already been uploaded to the collection. They all thought it was a good idea for a project, and some had ideas for sites in Sanday which could be included. In the workshop, they all got to try a Hudl tablet, and some of them found it enjoyable while others found it difficult. A couple had previous experience using a tablet, but most were beginners. We recorded the Sanday Community Centre together and spoke about how they could then make more records themselves at the places in the island where they have memories to share.

Lesson learned: Some of the oldest people felt they were 'too old' to learn anything new and also that their information wasn’t 'valuable'. There is a big threshold from showing them as a group, and getting them to try it there and then, to actually going out and recording things themselves. They seemed interested while we were trying it in the community centre, but then at the end when I asked who would like to take a Hudl home to have a go themselves then nobody took one. (However, two people had their own iPads and they said they would collect information on them). The lesson is that for very old people, you need a person to accompany them out in the field while they make the records. Simply showing them how to do it is not enough. You can see a picture of the event [here](https://twitter.com/NordicUHI/status/610830734782300160)

Orkney and Shetland 6th June. Workshops held at the same time at Orkney and Shetland Colleges. Both workshops had been advertised in the local papers and BBC Radio Orkney and Shetland, as well as the local Heritage associations. In Orkney a number of people turned up, who all had their own tablets and smart phones. They were very inspired by the project and felt that they had information that they wanted to record. One participant in particular was keen to teach other older community members how to use the app. She had one or two particular people in mind. At the beginning of the workshop we connected the two colleges via a VC link so that the participants could say hello to each other.

The Shetland workshop, although  small in numbers was still a success, as one of the people who attended was from Fair Isle and is very involved with heritage and tourism on the island. She was very interested in the software. She tried one of the Hudls and also got me to help her download the app on to her phone. She will go back to Fair Isle, show off the app and discuss the project with people there. Andrew has been invited to go to Fair Isle in July or early September to meet older people there and encourage them to use the software and start collecting stories. There is now some competition developing between the outlying areas of Shetland about who is going to use the app most!

Orkney 12th June:
Two members of the public visited Centre for Nordic Studies. They had missed the workshop on 6th June and came in to learn how to take part in the project. We guided them through how to use Fieldtrip on a tablet. They intended to involve their parents in the project.

Lesson learned: These were people in their 60s who were experienced users of digital technology. They picked up in a few minutes what it took 90 minutes for the Sanday Afternoon Club members to learn. They will aid the project by accompanying their parents out to record things.

Orkney 16th June:
Ragnhild Ljosland spent an hour and a half with a project participant: a 64-year-old who had never used a tablet before. The participant has grown up in Kirkwall and the time was spent walking around the centre of Kirkwall making records of memories and stories from the 1950s and 60s.

Lesson learned: This participant had never used a tablet before, but found the project very enjoyable and reasonably easy, although she did have some trouble at first finding the right technique to touch the screen – not to short and not too long. We got a lot of recording done and the participant was getting the hang of using the tablet by the end. It shows that accompanying participants out in the field, one-to-one, is a worthwhile thing to do. You can see

Shetland 18th May:
Andrew Jennings met Pat Christie the chairperson of the Shetland Heritage Association to show her how to use Fieldtrip GB. Pat is also the secretary of Cunningsburgh History Group, which is very popular with the older folk in Cunningsburgh. She was intrigued by the app and Andrew showed her how to do download it on to her iPhone. She was very keen to get the older people at the Cunningsburgh History Group involved as they have lots of stories to tell. She was also very keen to set up a trip to Skerries, one of the UK’s most isolated communities, where there are a number of older people who would love to learn how to use modern technology to preserve their heritage for the future. Pat found the app easy to use, which cheered her mightily. She has managed to organise a visit to Skerries and has informed everyone there to be ready. The trip will take place on the 18th of June, weather permitting.

Lesson learned: Pat was wary of the technology at first. She usually gets her family to set things up for her. However she was excited by the result and could quickly see the possible uses. She was recruited as a supporter of the project and went off to the Cunningsburgh History Group to encourage them to invite Andrew to attend their next meeting. It is a good idea to encourage a local person to tell others. They are likely to believe the project has merit and the technology is easy to use if one of their peers is a supporter. 

Lesson learned: Advertising widely does not necessarily encourage large numbers to turn up. However, if the right person does turn up then the project can be taken directly into the outlying communities. Finding the right vector is important.

16th June:
Andrew Jennings visited the island of Whalsay to meet older people learning about genealogy at the Learning Centre in Symbister House, the local school. The meeting was organised by the local tutor. The participants were keen to practice with the Hudls and to go outside and take photographs. Whalsay has a very active local history association and the chair was present. She was very excited about the prospect of collecting stories about her island. She usually gets her grandson to set up her phone and computer and so was a little tentative at first, but quickly got the hang of the software and had it downloaded on to her phone. She is going to practice with the software and tell other people in the history association. Andrew will return to Whalsay soon to show them how to use the equipment.

Lesson learned: If people are convinced of the benefit of the technology for themselves, and can see how they can use it do something they want, they are keen to use it. 

19/6/15:
Kim Foden returned and invited Ragnhild out for a walk around Kirkwall to record more memories of Kirkwall in the 1950 and 60 and how the town has grown. We spent about two hours walking around and making recordings. Kim is now fully capable of using the tablet to make her own recordings, and was doing it herself, but felt it was better to have Ragnhild with her to avoid the awkwardness of speaking to herself.

24/6/15: 
Ragnhild Ljosland went out to Dyke End on Scapa Bay to visit Johnnie Meil (age: 91) who had spoken to another participant and was keen to get involved in the project. He had never used a tablet before. Although he preferred Ragnhild to work the technology for him, he did have a go at taking photos and using the voice recorder on the tablet. Johnnie was delighted to share memories and stories from World War 2 in Orkney, and we made 7 recordings regarding various aspects of wartime Orkney. We agreed that Ragnhild would come back another day to do more, as he has lots of stories he wishes to share. Lesson learned: One memory led to another for Johnnie, while Ragnhild was trying to separate them out in different records. We ended up saying “could you wait a minute while I store this bit first” a lot, and we also ended up with several records being made in the same GPS position which will make the dots appear over the top of one another on the map. From the technology’s point of view it is easier to move around to one place at a time, but from the participant’s point of view it feels more natural to speak about lots of different things in a string of associations without having to stop, save, and move.

4-5/7: Ragnhild spent a weekend in Flotta gathering stories and memories. The lesson learned this time was that there are many stories which are deemed unfit to be out in public, as part of this project on a freely available website, because they are controversial or involve trouble such as inheritance and money trouble, or family conflicts of one sort or another, or would bring shame in one way or another to living relatives in the community. But these are often the most exciting stories and interesting portrayals of island life. In Flotta, which had a large camp for soldiers in World War Two, I heard marvellous stories about how the locals managed to make a bit of extra money out of the situation, but these were deemed unfit for the public ear! So although we got a lot recorded, there was just as much again which I was not allowed to record. One of the devices was left behind in Flotta and is going to spend the next few weeks there. Hopefully more people will use it.

9/7/15
Ragnhild spent a lovely evening in Firth with Neil Leask who shared some good stories. I have now at last figured out how to get around the problem that the GPS times out before getting a position.   

16/7/15 
Andrew's trip to The Skerries had to be postponed until later in August as the weather made a flight impossible. That is one of the problems with involving Scotland's most isolated islands in a project of this type. Sometimes nature is against you! However, in July a different isolated island was reached, the beautiful, little inhabited island of Fetlar. Andrew Jennings visited the island by ferry and spent the day at the Heritage Centre with Frances who was very keen to learn how to use the equipment and to encourage others on the island to use it. She practised taking pictures of the unusual items in the heritage centre, like Jeemsie Laurenson's ditty box. Frances had told many islanders about Andrew's arrival. However, despite being keen to find out more, only a couple of people turned up. Frances decided to borrow one of the Hudls and show it to the community after Andrew had left. She also wanted to put it into practice by interviewing one of the oldest islanders and recording some of her stories

Lesson learned: Frances was very keen to learn how to use the equipment and to encourage others. However, despite her best efforts, most people she contacted were too busy doing other things. To counteract this she decided to borrow the Hudl and show it round the island.

## Evaluation

The project will be continuously evaluated. Participants will complete a questionnaire at the start and end of the project. 10% of the participants will also be interviewed. In this way CNS will establish the success of the project from the start. The amount of data captured and uploaded will also be continuously monitored. 


### Outputs and outcomes
