<strong>One digital - the story so far in numbers.</strong>

Since February 2016 the [One Digital](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/onedigital/) team have been on tour, bringing digital participation to Third sector organisations, staff and volunteers. With the help of 32 local anchor organisations, One Digital sessions have been delivered on mainland Scotland from Dumfries to Inverness and Ayr to Aberdeen. On the Islands from Stornoway to Kirkwall and on to Lerwick.

During this time <strong>50</strong> One Digital sessions were delivered to over <strong>260</strong> Third sector organisations with over <strong>400</strong> people attending.

<br><strong>Making Digital Work</strong> was training designed to help organisations to use digital more. 19% of all organisations who attended Making Digital Work stated that their organisation was able to carry out all of the Basic Digital Skill tasks before they came to the session. That’s just over 50 organisations stating they could:

* Manage Information online e.g. use [Funding Scotland](http://www.fundingscotland.com/Account/MemberLoginRegister?ReturnUrl=%2F) or store information about donors securely

* Communicate online e.g. send emails, use [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/), [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/) or [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)

* Carry out online transactions, e.g. use online banking and receive online donations 

* Create something digital e.g. a profile on [Good HQ](https://goodhq.org/) or use [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

* Use the internet to problem-solve e.g. use [Google Analytics](https://www.google.co.uk/analytics/#?modal_active=none) to update a website, [YouTube Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE2241F1FF27BECB) or sign-up to the [Digital Participation Charter](http://charter.scvo.org.uk/)

<br><strong>Making Digital Everyday</strong> was training designed to help get end-users online. 47% of individuals who attended Making Digital Everyday had all five Basic Digital Skills and could, search for deals on comparison websites like [U-Switch](https://www.uswitch.com/), post on forums using [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/l/en-gb/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), book holidays online, Google a solution to a problem, create and share a text document e.g. a C.V. 

<strong>90%</strong> of participants stated they would recommend One Digital to others and a whopping <strong>93%</strong> of all those who attended the sessions stated they were satisfied and very satisfied with them.

<br>For me, as a member of the One Digital team it is very satisfying to hear what participants said about the training:

<strong><i>“Excellent training, I've learnt so much… thank you.”</i></strong>

<strong><i>“It was really useful to have the opportunity to learn, share and think about how we can support each other and all reach more people.”</i></strong>

<strong><i>“Excellent starting point to take ownership and get started with my digital inclusion project”</i></strong>

<strong><i>“The informal environment made it easy for people to interact, ask questions, and share information. Feeling inspired!”</i></strong>

<br>Confidence grew in using social media, organisations felt they could reach wider audiences and make targeted posts. New ideas were generated and shared, information exchanged, questions answered, solutions found, plans made and people inspired.
