As part of the new One Digital programme we are delivering action learning sets for senior leaders who want to <strong>transform their organisation’s approach to digital.</strong>  

Organisations in the third sector have much to gain from the shift to digital, but many are in danger of being left behind. If we can put the third sector on the front foot when it comes to digital then we can make a real impact on social justice, public service delivery and economic growth, however, currently half of all Scottish charities (20,000 organisations) [lack basic digital skills](/images/infographic-2015-white.png).

There are often a number of complex reasons why charities struggle to become more digital, including time, motivation, resourcing and access to training and support. The One Digital project has brought together three groups of senior third sector leaders who are keen to tackle this issue. Using [action learning methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_learning) the groups meet and support one another to work together to find solutions to the problems they are facing.

Digital transformation is a major undertaking for any organisation, and unless the people at the very top have a sound understanding of the opportunity and a vision for grasping it then change will only ever be incremental.

## Action learning sets

The leaders meet monthly to tackle real problems or issues. The action learning process promotes curiosity, inquiry, and reflection. There is a requirement that talk be converted into action and, ultimately, a solution.

The sets are facilitated by an independent expert, [Ross McCulloch](https://twitter.com/ThirdSectorLab) from [Third Sector Lab](http://thirdsectorlab.co.uk/) and [Be Good Be Social](http://begoodbesocial.org.uk/).

Along the way we expect to cover many of the topics that leaders increasingly encounter: language and methodologies, collaborating with developers, innovation, IP and so on. We will link all these back to the big picture, so that participants will see digital as a tool for advancing their organisation's mission and don't get side-tracked into thinking about digital as an end in itself.  

As well as enhancing networking within the sector by identifying groups of like-minded people facing similar challenges, we also want to make connections between third sector leaders and their peers in other domains. Strong speakers from a range of different sectors have been invited because their stories tell of using digital to accelerate the impact of their organisation.  

### 3rdsectordigicamp 

<strong>Wednesday 2nd November 2016<br> 
200 St Vincent Street Glasgow<br> 
10am-4pm<br> 
Free event</strong> 

Facilitated by Ross McCulloch (Third Sector Lab), Paul Webster (co-founder of VCSScamp) and Beth Murphy (SCVO). 

SCVO are bringing together senior leaders and stakeholders from across the third sector for our first <strong>digiscotcamp</strong>. If you lead, govern, fund or support the third sector in Scotland and you want to get together with like-minded people for a day to discuss how to bring about digital change please join us! 

The day will be an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) format so there is no set plan or agenda (or sales pitches) before the day starts. All that’s needed is your desire to talk about the many ways that digital technology has changed the landscape we work in, and as Senior leaders and influencers what we are doing, or could/should be doing about and with it. 

The event will build on the work that has been done by CEOs and Directors engaged in the [One Digital project](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/onedigital/) over the course of 2016. These senior leaders will be part of the event, sharing their learnings and experiences, and the issues that they have been tackling as they bring about digital change in their own organisations. You can read more about the themes arising from this project in a new article by Ross tbc.

This event is intended for senior leaders, influencers and funders. Whilst we won’t refuse a booking from others, due to capacity of the venue we may have to hold back bookings as we expect the event to be very popular. We hope you understand. 

Because the event is an unconference we create the agenda on the day. But we do know a few of the key moments: 
 
- 09.30: arrivals and coffee 
- 10.00: introduction to the day  
- 10.30: timetable is co-created 
- 11.00: sessions start 
- 12.45: lunch  
- 15.30: wrap up 

## What is an Unconference?  

It’s called an unconference because, unlike a traditional conference, there is no fixed agenda, no-one has selected the speakers before the event, no-one has decided what an ‘important topic’ to cover is and no-one has been paid to deliver a ‘death by powerpoint’ keynote speech! 

At an unconference everyone has equal opportunity to speak and equal space to collaborate and share what matters to them.
[This link gives some more background to what an unconference is all about.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)

## Are there any rules for an unconference? 

We don’t like the word ‘rules’, but there are some guidelines around which an unconference works best. They really are quite informal. 

1)     The people who come are the best people who could have come.<br> 
2)     We all take a share in making the day run smoothly and steering our own path of learning through the day.<br> 
3)     Whatever happens is the only thing that could have happened.<br> 
4)     It starts when it starts.<br> 
5)     It’s over when it’s over.<br> 
6)     There is no agenda until individuals pitch session titles and ideas. (This will grow on a board at the front/side/back of the room, probably using brightly coloured Post-its). You don’t need all the answers to ‘pitch’, indeed an ‘I don’t know the answer to this ….’ pitch often produces the best discussions!<br> 
7)     Each session will be given a room (or a space in the main room) and a starting time slot. We will try to start sessions on time, but Rule 5 applies, so if you have exhausted the conversation after 30 minutes and just want to network (or talk about kittens & cake instead) that’s fine.<br> 
8)     There is a ‘Law of Two Feet’ i.e. if you don’t feel you are learning, a session isn’t quite what you expected or not relevant to you, feel free to visit another discussion. Just move on quietly and with respect, but don’t feel trapped. You can come and go as you please.<br> 
9)     If you pitch a session, you must be there at the stated time to start the discussion flowing. However this doesn’t mean that you have to lead the session or even steer the discussion. We are all learning. You can ask questions or talk about your work, but try not to make it too sales-y.<br> 
10)    Participants are encouraged to take notes, tweet and even blog about each session to feed back to others, including those not physically present at digiscotcamp.
