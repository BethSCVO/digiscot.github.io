### Online learning modules

Working in partnership with Digital Unite, we are able to offer free access to a range of online learning modules. These will help you to develop the skills to become a digital champion. 

1. What people say about the courses:

	* “When trying to engage people with very limited skills the digital world can be a confusing place, the course does a good job in simplifying with a focus on giving confidence.”
	* “I liked the structure of the course, the fact sheets and the multiple choice questions. It is a fantastic course and I hope more people become digital champions."

2. Topics covered by the courses:

	You can sign up for a number of different courses, depending on your interest and skills. Each course takes around 25 minutes to complete, and you can pause and save your answers as you go. Available courses cover these topics:

	* Making Digital Everyday – how to be a digital champion

	* Making Digital Work – how to make your organisation more digitally effective

	* Digital fun: using the internet to help people love later life!

	* How to use the Internet to develop your professional profile

	* Essentials for engaging with older people

	* Using UK government services online

	* Making and saving money online

	* Online security, banking and money

	* Finding a job

<strong>How to get involved</strong>

If you would like to access the online modules, or you like to make them available to other people in your organisation email us at [onedigital@scvo.org.uk](mailto:onedigital@scvo.org.uk).

## Events

We run a programme of free of charge training and events. From September we will be supporting a series of <strong>‘meetups’</strong> across the country.

If you come along to a meetup you will find a friendly and welcoming atmosphere, designed for people who are interested but not necessarily experienced with technology. Local organisations will talk about their successes and challenges in a particular area, for example using social media. There will be lots of space to talk and network, and learn from others in the room.

If you have never been to a meetup before don’t worry- we would love to have you along. <strong>[Click here](http://www.meetup.com/One-Digital-Meetup/)</strong> to find out where and when your closest meetup is taking place.

#### Training Courses

We also run training and are interested in hearing from organisations who feel they would benefit from a session for their staff. We offer two courses and the focus of these is outlined below:
