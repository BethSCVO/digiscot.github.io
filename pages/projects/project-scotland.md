## Project plan

### Project description

To support 6 volunteer workshops introducing the social media tool LinkedIn as a tool for networking and effective job searching. Workshops will be provided physically and online, making use of digital conferencing technology. 


## Project milestones

### Software Development: Ongoing

Have identified Webex software to use to deliver webinars and are currently working with the company and our LinkedIn trainer [Jackie Cameron](http://www.consultcameron.com/) to develop her exisiting LinkedIn workshop for webinar format.

We have had to change software providers due to initial communication problems, and delivery issues, however now we are confident with the provider and have completed the 'induction' process.

### Delivery: Workshop 1, February 2015

1st LinkedIn workshop delivered at [Let's Get Sporty](http://letsgetsporty.com/) in Dumfries

8 of our volunteers in Dumfries and the surrounding area attended this workshop.  All who attended felt they learned something new and valuable with 100% reporting that they have a greater understanding of how to present their personal qualities to employers and others.

"Today made me notice that there is a lot of different choices towards finding a job."
"Interested me in the possibilities and opportunities that using social media correctly can hold."

### Delivery: Workshop 2, April 2015

2nd LinkedIn workshop took place in Glasgow hosted by [PwC](http://www.pwc.co.uk/) 

11 volunteers attended this workshop, 60% of whom had little or no experience of using LinkedIn prior to the workshop.  100% of participants felt they had 'lots' of knowledge post workshop and all told us they would continue to use LinkedIn to help with job searching and networking.

"Just thanks for an interesting afternoon - it's encouraging to see successful people helping the younger generation out, and greatly appreciated."
"Really enjoyed [Jackie Cameron](http://www.consultcameron.com/)'s workshop - her information was presented passionately and will help me when job hunting."
"It was positive and we were given personal and valuable advice."

### Delivery: Webinar Development, throughout 2015

1st Webinar to be delivered in Edinburgh at ProjectScotland office.  Having adapted the existing LinkedIn workshops, the webinar will run for c. 40 minutes and be delivered to a maximum of 10 young people (remote) to enable us to test the delivery and engagement of participants, to trouble-shoot problems. Development of the software and practical considerations took place throughout the latter half of 2015 with the first webinar aiming for delivery beginning of 2016

Post webinar, we will reveiew with the trainer and note any changes to make for subsequent webinars.  We will collect feedback from volunteers.  Pending any significant changes being required to delivery this webinar will then be made available to current and past ProjectScotland volunteers.

### Delivery: Workshop 3, 8th October 2015 - Dundee

This workshop took place in the Prince's Trust offices in Dundee on 8th October. We secured 16 sign ups (target attendance of 15) however on the day attendance was low, at 3. This was really disappointing given the efforts put into organising. Within Dundee the young people we work with are further from work, and have multiple barriers and chaotic circumstances surrounding their current situation. This can affect attendance to both their voluntary placements and the development opportunities. 

Saying that, all attendees found that the workshop was relevant to their individual goals and that the content was well delivered. They also all agreed that they now better understood the qualities that employers were looking for and have greater understanding about how Linkedin can help them do that. We are learning that Linkedin has not been a tool that young people either engage with, or understand, in terms of how it can affect future employment. The volunteers attending this workshop certainly echoed that and left feeling that they now knew how best to engage with Linkedin, and use the tool for their own journey.

### Delivery: Workshop 4, 21st October 2015

LinkedIn workshop in Glasgow hosted by PWC

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There&#39;s still time to sign up for our latest workshop! Why not harness the power of social media and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GetOnInLife?src=hash">#GetOnInLife</a>? <a href="http://t.co/pp2MJWblZd">http://t.co/pp2MJWblZd</a></p>&mdash; ProjectScotland (@ProjectScotland) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectScotland/status/656098277364994049">October 19, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

"One of the real successes was that at the start the participants were asked what they wanted to get from the workshop. This provided clear objectives for the session that were tailored to our needs. The trainer (Jackie) was then able to focus on the issues that were important to us. Jackie was incredibly knowledgeable on how to create a fantastic  LinkedIn profiles and also ways to link this with other social media platforms. She also encouraged us to “connect” with her if we had any questions in the future." Phil Stephenson, ProjectScotland volunteer and attendee

After this workshop we have noticed a need to tweak the content so that it is continually refreshed and encompasses our learnings of Linkedin workshops thus far.

### Delivery: Workshop 5, 1st pilot webinar, 21 January 2016

Key Learnings with regards to delivery:
1. Quite technical to deliver a webinar therefore we have encouraged our trainer to research and watch more webinars to develop the techniques in time for the next webinar
2. The platform doesn't allow participants to engage with each other and thus see any questions that participants may have asked. It would be useful if all participants could engage in the 'chat' tool during the webinar and allow all to see feedback
3. Turnout was far better than workshops in person. 11 confirmed, 10 attended. This shows that for the young people we work with webinars are definitely the preferred option


### Delivery: Workshop 6, 23rd February 2016

Social Media and Job Hunting  - Creating your own success; hosted by our charity partners Young Enterprise Scotland, Glasgow

9 young people signed up to this workshop but only 5 attended. This cements our learnings that whilst young people are keen to develop their online skills, sometimes the barriers to attendance prevent this. All attendees stated that they learnt something news with comments such as 'I learnt how to present myself better on Linkedin for job opportunities' and 'The importance of Linkedin in finding new jobs.' And our trainer, Jackie Cameron, was even described as fabulous!

100% agreed that the content was relevant to their goal of finding employment
80% of attendees stated that they had improved their skills in applying for jobs/development opportunities
And all attendees agreed that the content was well delivered and useful.

### Webinar & Website development: Ongoing

ProjectScotland website development of 'learning bank' for yougn people to access the webinars and other related links and information- a permanent online resource to be accessed by all ProjectScotland volunteers and other young people.
