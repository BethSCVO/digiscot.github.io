### Project description

Quarriers ( through its Go4It project, an award winning project which helps people we support develop digital skills), partnering with the Glasgow Centre for Independent Living ( a disabled led organisation), wish to use the opportunity given by the Digital Challenge Fund to undertake a piece of Action Research on digital exclusion. We aim to find out underlying stories about why people have been digitally excluded or chosen not to use computers, and the impact of then being digitally included. 

Our “Stories from the Digital Divide” project will work intensively with twelve people with learning disabilities living in Glasgow and the surrounding area. This is a group known to face above average rates of digital exclusion. Within that group we would expect to have people who are older and who are seeking social security allowances. By spending time getting to know them, and working closely with them to develop their basic digital skills (by delivering Quarriers DigiKnow basic IT skills course) over a three month period, the project will be able to produce a piece of grounded action research, rich in qualitative data that seeks to find out more about why people have been digitally excluded and what sort of actions lead to them moving beyond exclusion into participation. 

The project will work with twelve individuals to fully document their story around digital exclusion - mapping their story, describing their learning journey on the project and explaining the outcome of their experience. Data on the participants will be collected throughout their time on the project by project staff through semi structured interviews, informal conversations, questionnaires and observations. Data will be collected on an individual 

participant basis but discussions involving the whole group will also take place to increase the likelihood of peer reflection and support taking place. 

Once the twelve participants have been selected they will be split into three groups. Each group will then be tutored once a fortnight for two hours over three months. This number is kept small because this project aim is to focus on each individual and produce an accurate study of their situation and their progress. At the outset a baseline on each participant’s digital skills and experience will be recorded. Any future progress will be measured against this baseline. 

Trained Quarriers and GCIL facilitators will provide individually tailored support and tutoring to each participant. covering switching the computer on and off, keyboard and mouse use, opening and closing windows, internet use and safety, skype, email and on line shopping. Participant’s progress and uptake of technology will be tracked via outcomes from the Go On UK basic digital skills framework making use of, for example, online quizzes. 

Over the year, the impact of having technology in their lives will be tracked to see if tackling the divide head on can bridge the gap.

### Planned project milestones

* The first group of four will have their first interview session for background story, and then trained over three months to use the tablets provided: January 2016

* The second group will have been interviewed, and trained over three months to use tablets provided. The first group will have undergone their three month follow up interview: May 2016

* The third group will have been interviewed, and trained over three months to use the tablets provided. The second group will have been given their three month follow up interview: September 2016

* The third group will have been given their three month follow up, and this will be added to a report and published online for national consumption: December 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* The primary outcome of this project is to produce an Action Research report which will look in detail at twelve ‘stories’ from the digital divide and to attempt to find why people are digitally excluded. The report will be an evolution of the existing data and learning currently on digital inclusion and participation, and will introduce a more in depth level of study than previously achieved.  This insight should be able to inform other projects and groups working with the target group in this project on how best to tackle the digital divide. Recommendations will be made the final report which will outline how this can be achieved.

* A second outcome of this project is that the participants of the study will be trained in the use of technology at no cost to themselves. Proper training with specialist staff knowledge of accessibility options can be very expensive. In this instance, the participants will have access to training throughout the project, and their individual stories will help to inspire others who may be facing similar situations to participate digitally. The participants will learn how to navigate their devices, email and video call, browse the internet, fill out forms online and how to stay safe online. The participants will also be able to retain the devices after the study is complete, which has removed a cost barrier. Very often, people can attend basic digital skills classes with no way to continue learning at home. In this instance, all participants will be able to achieve all the benefits of training for practical use outside the class.

* The final outcome is that Go4IT, GCIL and all the organisations who have referred others to the project will have their profiles raised by an important landmark study which tackles the very core of the digital divide. This improved profile will lead to others learning more of the digital inclusion and learning services on offer, and spread information about how to help others become digital participants.
