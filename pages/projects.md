We're supporting a wide range of digital participation projects in communities across Scotland. Many of these are benefiting from financial support from our [challenge fund](/resources/challenge-fund/), whilst others are receiving in-kind support from organisations that have signed our [digital participation charter](/charter/).Each of them has a page on this site to tell their story in their own words.

You can also [explore the projects by tag](/projects/tags/) or [by date funded](/projects/tag/#call1), or [see an interactive map](/projects/map/) of where things are happening.
