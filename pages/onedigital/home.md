The One Digital team at SCVO have been awarded £500k from the Big Lottery Fund in an effort to better understand how to make a significant and sustainable improvement in the [Basic Digital Skills](http://www.go-on.co.uk/get-involved/basic-digital-skills/) of the people most in need.

This activity is part of a wider two million pound [One Digital](https://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/global-content/press-releases/uk-wide/090915_uk_digital-skills/) programme, which has been developed by a consortium of organisations including SCVO, [Digital Unite](http://digitalunite.com/), [Age UK](http://www.ageuk.org.uk/) and [Citizens Online](http://www.citizensonline.org.uk/). Our projects will benefit people with disabilities and accessibility needs, young adults seeking work, over 65s and charities and the people they support, so that they are able to access essential online services, search and apply for jobs and stay in touch with friends and family.

Each of the partners will run a project which will equip trusted intermediaries to act as ‘Digital Champions’, able to support a wide range of people to develop their Basic Digital Skills.  The Digital Champions will, for example, demonstrate the use of Skype to an older person to help them stay in touch with grandchildren and family or provide a young person with the skills to search for work and complete an online CV.
