As part of the new One Digital programme we are delivering action learning sets for senior leaders who want to <strong>transform their organisationâ€™s approach to digital.</strong>  

Organisations in the third sector have much to gain from the shift to digital, but many are in danger of being left behind. If we can put the third sector on the front foot when it comes to digital then we can make a real impact on social justice, public service delivery and economic growth, however, currently half of all Scottish charities (20,000 organisations) [lack basic digital skills](/images/infographic-2015-white.png).

There are often a number of complex reasons why charities struggle to become more digital, including time, motivation, resourcing and access to training and support. The One Digital project has brought together three groups of senior third sector leaders who are keen to tackle this issue. Using [action learning methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_learning) the groups meet and support one another to work together to find solutions to the problems they are facing.

Digital transformation is a major undertaking for any organisation, and unless the people at the very top have a sound understanding of the opportunity and a vision for grasping it then change will only ever be incremental. 

## Action learning sets

The leaders meet monthly to tackle real problems or issues. The action learning process promotes curiosity, inquiry, and reflection. There is a requirement that talk be converted into action and, ultimately, a solution.

The sets are facilitated by an independent expert, [Ross McCulloch](https://twitter.com/ThirdSectorLab) from [Third Sector Lab](http://thirdsectorlab.co.uk/) and [Be Good Be Social](http://begoodbesocial.org.uk/). 

Along the way we expect to cover many of the topics that leaders increasingly encounter: language and methodologies, collaborating with developers, innovation, IP and so on. We will link all these back to the big picture, so that participants will see digital as a tool for advancing their organisation's mission and don't get side-tracked into thinking about digital as an end in itself.  

As well as enhancing networking within the sector by identifying groups of like-minded people facing similar challenges, we also want to make connections between third sector leaders and their peers in other domains. Strong speakers from a range of different sectors have been invited because their stories tell of using digital to accelerate the impact of their organisation.
