## A year of One Digital

Throughout 2016 the One Digital team at SCVO have been developing the digital skills and confidence of the Scottish third sector. The project was funded by the Big Lottery fund, and part of a wider consortium delivering across the UK. 

Over the course of the year we have raised the profile of digital participation and evolution with over 1000 staff and volunteers, and 500 of these have been trained as digital champions. 

We have tested a range of delivery models, working with frontline staff and senior leaders from diverse organisations. The University of the West of Scotland have evaluated these different approaches.
