## Project plan


### Project description

We will employ a specialised Digital Advisor one day per week to deliver digital inclusion workshops and personalised one-to-one support.  The post-holder will be home-based and responsible for delivering the following activities over 9 months:  6 digital outreach community workshops and work with 40 disabled people learn basic online skills across the Highlands.  The project will: Build IT literacy capacity of people with disabilities through increased digital inclusion and specialised support; Digital inclusivity will lead to disabled people having the opportunity to maintain and cultivate relationships (both professionally and personally), promoting social inclusion and enhanced well-being; Increase disabled clients’ opportunities to access various online tools, such as, completing employment applications, internet banking, online shopping, email, and social networking; Increased self-esteem and confidence in people with disabilities, leading to more people with disabilities becoming digitally engaged and improving their quality of life.

## Project Milestones

We organised a meeting with Cheshire House in order to determine what subjects the clients would be interested
in.  Each client was asked what they would like to achieve and the reasons they wanted to become more proficient in use of the computer.#
We gave them some ideas but also asked for their preferences:
-	Internet safety
-	Basic course of using computers
-	How to use the technology (moving on to how to use it by yourself)
-	How to find things on the internet
-	Want to find educational games (lower the amount of time spent on youtube)
-	How to edit settings on the computer (i.e. increase the font size, change size of the cursor -> looking at it for different versions)
-	How they can use a computer to make art
-	Other Points
-	Additional equipment (chin buttons, arms, magnifying screens)
-	Interested in having volunteers to help with computers
-	
We have included below the numbers interested in the different workshop areas. Unfortunately we won’t be able to combine the workshop currently due to the limited amount of computers and high interest from day services. We are hoping to fix an additional computer that will enable us to run the workshop for five people.

There is definitely a possibility of getting both volunteers and residents involved depending on their availability.

We have arranged to run a workshop on 8th September and will begin with basics such as turning computer on/off and accessing the internet.
We have spoken to Cantraybridge College and have carried out a similar process where have asked for preferences and we will begin with them on 15th September.

8th September 2015
We delivered a workshop at Cheshire House to 5 clients of varying capabilities and after completing an initial assessment form and a permission to use their images we discussed their individual requirements re the workshop and we began with a basic session in how to turn on the computer.  This was followed by information on the different parts of the computer and what they all do.  After starting the computer we looked at the desktop and how to navigate to different places.  The general input was that although several of the clients were able to access programmes such as social network sites they had to be set up by a third party.  We looked at how to access the internet and how to use a search engine and every one, some with assistance was able to access a website of their choice.  The general feedback was that the session had been useful and the clients had benefitted from it.  The session was delivered in a light-hearted manner and this aproach seems to work with this particular client group. We made a decision on our session for the following week and we will be exlaining how to use email.

Had a discussion with Alison at Cantraybridge College to prepare for our first workshop on the 15th September.  We checked all the resources were in place and looked at the room in which we will be delivering the session which contains a smart board and several laptops although some of the students will use their own.  We will be following the programme from Cheshire House but will change any aspects as we progress.

 Delivered the second workshop at Cheshire House.  Started with a Q & A on the previous week and all information had been successfully retained.  We looked at email and I set up a new email address for all the clients and showed them how to write and send emails.  We sent a number back and forth between the clients and a colleague & me making it a successful session. The clients are now confident in the use of email and we then touched on social networking, which will be our session for next week.  I had 5 clients and the feedback from Lisa Oliver suggests that they are gaining some knowledge and experience from the sessions.
Delivered the first workshop at Cantraybridge College to 5 and later 6 students.  All Initial Assessments and permission slips were completed and after an initial hiccup, which was soon ironed out, we then had a successful session.  The clients are slightly more advanced than the group at Cheshire House so we started a little farther along the road.  I ensured however that no one was not at the same place and we had a discussion about internet safety to which I gave several tips and ideas that the clients took on board.  The group indicated that they would like more information on email and writing a cv which will be the basis of our next session.
22nd September 2015
Delivered 3rd session at Cheshire House and we covered e mail attachments and internet searching.  We explained how to access images on the internet and used them as attachments which we emailed to each other as a practice.  We also did the same with videos and on both we had a successful session and gave the clients the ability to interact with their peer group.  This was well received as they are not resident at Cheshire House and enjoy keeping in contact with each other when they are not attending the centre.
We are waiting for the arrival of some equipment that will improve use of the computer to several of the clients such as easier to read monitors and this will surely enhance the skills that the clients are developing.
We have decided on a session on online activities for next week and will look at educational games as well as other related items.

Delivered 2nd session at Cantraybridge College and covered email and storing documents in the cloud system so that it is always available to the user.  We looked at Outlook’s One Drive and Google Drive and ran through the system and how to upload documents and then attach them to emails. We then demonstrated how achieve this and the group seemed quite happy with this as it was a system with which they were unfamiliar. We then looked at Microsoft applications and concentrated on Word where we looked at the tool bars and explained all the functions and their use in composing a document.  The clients then experimented on their laptops and wrote some text and changed the font, pitch, colour and appearance amongst other things and seemed comfortable with this.
We also looked at a programme to help with gaining typing skills and we will pursue this at the next session and had a general discussion on what other subjects we would cover in the following week and the group decided that they would like some more information on Office programmes so we will look at Excel and Power Point. 
Tuesday 29th September 2015
Delivered a session at Cheshire House and we covered social media. Set up everyone that did not have one with a Facebook account.  We explained how to use the account safely, setting privacy settings and then showed the group how to set up a profile including a photo and a cover photo.  Demonstrated how to post stories and share them with “friends” and attach items such as photos and pictures.  We looked at instant messaging and practiced sending messages to one person and how to form a group of “friends”.  Once again this was a useful exercise as the group are all day clients and like to keep in touch with each other when not in the centre.  One of the clients had a new iphone so we had a mini session on setting up social network sites on this.  The groups then sent messages and pictures to each other as individuals and as a group.

Delivered a session at Cantraybridge College and we covered the use of Word documents in more detail.  We looked at composing a document and how to make it look professional, easy to read and stand out.  We ran through the various aspects of Word from selecting a blank page or template through selecting fonts, pitch and layout.  I demonstrated how to set tabs and why we use them and we looked how to print a document.  I explained how spell check worked and we looked at the system which highlights in red for spelling, green for grammatical error and blue for contextualisation.  We then let the students write some text and then changed it in a number of ways such as pitch. Font, orientation and prepared it for printing a number of copies.  The candidates were all pleased with the information they have received over the last 3 weeks and they felt more confident about their abilities.  We presented them with a certificate to show they had attended the course and I offered to supply any further assistance that they may need.  
Tuesday 13th October 2015
Delivered a session at Cheshire House and we looked at utilising programmes and resources on the system to make a calendar. Set up a template so everyone had the same basic idea to work with. We then went through the months and tried to find some relevant picture for each one.  Demonstrated how to access pictures online using Google images and similar programmes.  Also used photographs from their files as most clients wanted to have a photograph of themselves on each month.  Explained how to cut and paste and increase and decrease sizing on pictures and how to move them to different places on the calendar. When we reached October this generated a discussion on Halloween and we then planned to design some posters for the Halloween party at out next session.  We will probably be finishing off the calendars at the next session as well but a few of the clients will be able to finish theirs beforehand.  We have planned to also look at educational games and how to access them and the value of playing them to help with things such as maths and English.

20th October 2015
Delivered a session at Cheshire House to 4 clients and we finished off the calendar project from last week.  Several clients wanted to change some of their pictures so we once again demonstrated how to access and save pictures/photographs to use in their calendar.  We also had requests to make cards for Halloween as well as posters and we found a template that would make the process easier.  We have now completed the calendars and will be printing and binding them in the next few days. We also looked at using animation on the calendars but as they all wanted them printed out this would not work.  I suggested that they keep a calendar on their computers but this was not what they wanted.  We had planned to also look at educational games and how to access them and the value of playing them to help with things such as maths and English but highlighted the need for a refresher on internet safety and will make this our session next week.
