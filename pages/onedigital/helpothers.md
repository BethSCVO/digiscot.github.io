## I want to help others to get online

Right now in Scotland 1 in 5 adults lack Basic Digital Skills. These people are more likely to be older, poorer and facing other forms of disadvantage. 

If you work or volunteer for an organisation that helps people who might find it difficult to access or use digital you can access training and support to <strong>become a digital champion</strong>.

Digital champions can come in all shapes and sizes. To be a digital champion all you need is some enthusiasm for helping others, and some time to take part in the training.  
 
## Online learning 
We can provide access free of charge to the Digital Champions Network. This online platform provides access to a range of training courses, and comes with support from a digital mentor and forums where you can chat to other Digital Champions about their experiences. 
“When trying to engage people with very limited skills the digital world can be a confusing place, the course does a good job in simplifying with a focus on giving confidence.” 

“I liked the structure of the course, the fact sheets and the multiple choice questions. It is a fantastic course and I hope more people become digital champions.” 

## Training courses 
If you have a team of 10 people or more who would benefit from training and support to help others get online then our Making Digital Everyday training could be for you. 

This course has been delivered to over 250 people, with over 95% satisfaction rates.

      A support group for people with MS wants to help users book GP appointments but the users show no interest. This training could mean that staff learn new techniques to hel users see the benefits of the internet and change their behaviour.</p>
