        <h2>I want to help others to get online</h2>
        <p>Right now in Scotland 1 in 5 adults lack Basic Digital Skills. These people are more likely to be older, poorer and facing other forms of disadvantage.</p>
        <p>If you work or volunteer for an organisation that helps people who might find it difficult to access or use digital you can access training and support to <strong>become a digital champion</strong>.</p>
        <p>Digital champions can come in all shapes and sizes. To be a digital champion all you need is some enthusiasm for helping others, and some time to take part in the training.</p>
