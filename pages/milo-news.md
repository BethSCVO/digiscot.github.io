### Training modules

The initial training modules are available to download on the <a href="http://digital.scvo.org.uk/data/milo-training/">training page</a>, along with a short video introduction to the new system. The initial six documents and the Quick Start Guide are intended to cover the main aspects of day-to-day use (Organisations, Opportunities, Volunteer Registrations, Interactions, etc.) – we’ll be adding more modules on Reporting, using Chatter etc. soon. Additional online help and training about the platform as a whole is available in the <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/hthome?siteLang=en_US">Salesforce Community.</a>

### Annual Profiling Data

The  **Annual Profiling Data** object is now available. This allows TSIs to capture data on their local sector’s financial, staffing and volunteering stats on an annual basis.
