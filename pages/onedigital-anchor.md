We’re delighted that you’re considering becoming or have already committed to being a One Digital Project anchor organisation.  It’s a vital role to help us to deliver and improve Basic Digital Skills across Scotland’s third sector.  Below are some frequently asked questions and answers to help inform your decision and to deliver your role. 

## What does the Project aim to do?

One Digital is aiming to develop the Basic Digital Skills of third sector organisations through Digital Champions.  We are a 'test and learn' initiative, and are offering two types of training and support: 

<strong> 1. Making Digital Work-</strong> this is designed to help organisations change the way they use digital

<strong> 2. Making Digital Everyday-</strong> this will help organisations to support their end users to change their behaviour and start using digital as part of their day to day 

One Digital aims to create a model of continuous Basic Digital Skill sharing that will reach far and wide across the sector, will be driven from within and will help to improve your services longer-term. For more information about what the Project aims to deliver please see [here](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/onedigital/). You can find our definition of Basic Digital Skills [here](https://goon-uk-prod.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/Basic-Digital-Skills-Framework-FINAL.pdf).


<strong> We need you to identify 20 third sector groups in your local area to take part in the following training and support programmes:</strong>

You will have the support of the One Digital Project Team throughout this process. 
Once identified and ‘signed-up’ we will need you to coordinate and host one training session for each group (we will provide the funding, trainer and training material).  We will also need you to encourage the ongoing development of Basic Digital Skills of the organisations with our support. 

## What sort of tasks will an anchor organisation be responsible for? 

- Promoting the opportunity to the third sector in their area

- Encouraging and supporting third sector groups to identify two people from each group to participate in their chosen programme

- Coordinating and carrying out the administration and coordination of the training, for example, distributing training materials and managing enquiries and bookings

- Arranging training venues for each of the training sessions

- Providing catering and refreshments for participants during the training

- Facilitating and participating in networking between the two streams and either linking to an existing local digital skills network (if you’re not already involved) or creating one

- Encouraging the ongoing development of Basic Digital Skills of the organisations with our support

- Being the main contact for collection of local One Digital evaluation data    

## What are the Project timescales? 

We are looking to begin rolling out the training from February 2016 onwards.  Our full Project timeline which will be kept up to date can be found [here](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/onedigital/).

## Are there criteria that the anchor organisations need to meet? 

For the majority of areas we will work with Third Sector Interfaces (TSIs) as our anchor organisations due to their wealth of local knowledge, experience and strong relationships with the local third sector.  We want the training to be as digital as possible and therefore require anchor organisations to identify training venues with good WIFI connections so that delegates can engage online during the day. 

Where TSIs are unable to fulfil the anchor organisation role, we are looking to work with an organisation that has a good working knowledge of their local third sector, established relationships and the capabilities to help coordinate training for several groups.   

## How many anchor organisations are there? 

We are looking to have one anchor organisation in each Local Authority Area of Scotland.  This will mean 32 anchor organisations in total. 

## What are the benefits to being an anchor organisation? 

You will help to establish and/or develop a Basic Digital Skills network in your area resulting in a digitally stronger and more resilient third sector. 

You can also improve your own organisation’s Basic Digital Skills by taking part in the training programme. 

You will receive resources, including funding, training and Project Team time to support you throughout, allowing your resources to be utilised for further important work. 

## Are there resources / support available? 

Yes. There is up to £2,000 funding available to each anchor organisation to support the One Digital Project.  £1,000 is an incentive payment to the anchor organisation that we hope will be used to continue to develop a Basic Digital Skills network in your area longer term.  
The other £1,000 is to cover the costs of the training, for example, recruiting participants, venue, catering and materials. 

We will also provide experienced trainers and high quality digital training materials for free.  Furthermore, you will have the full support of the One Digital Project Team with a dedicated Development Officer to help you throughout. 

## Can an anchor organisation also take part in the programme?  

Yes.  Anchor organisations are welcome to participate in the training and support programme as well as be the key coordinator for third sector groups in their area. 

## Are there criteria for groups to meet to take part in the programme? 

If the group is part of the third sector, could benefit from the training and support programme and is willing to take part fully then they are eligible. There are no restrictions on size, age of beneficiaries, remit or constitution for groups that wish to participate.  Our Development Officers are happy to review groups with you as part of their support to you.      

## Are there any communication templates to help us generate interest? 

These are currently in development and will be shared with our anchor organisations as soon as possible. We can support you in the meantime to utilise your own communication tools and to provide interim templates where appropriate.
