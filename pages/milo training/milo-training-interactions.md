#### Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

Interactions enable users to record details of the work they do with local organisations and volunteers. Interaction categories are unique to each local TSI, meaning they can be used to report on the work of the TSI at regular intervals.

Interactions in the new Milo system have been revamped to provide a more streamlined system than the old structure of Episodes and Interactions on the original system.

While it is possible to view historic interactions, together with the old subcategory, interactions from June 2015 will be recorded using the new interaction field.

#### Managing Interactions in Milo <a name="mange"></a>

One difference of interaction to other objects on the system is you will normally want to view and add interaction as they relate to a particular organisation or contact.

**Navigate to an interaction with an organisation** <a name="nav"></a>

Click on the Organisations tab and navigate to the organisation you are interested in, either by using the global search or a view. Click into the Organisation view. To see if there are any interactions, either scroll to the bottom of the page to view associated entities, or look at over the Interactions link at the top of the page. If the number in brackets is not 0, there are associated interactions.

Hover over the link to see the main details of the organisations interaction:

**Important**: there are <u>two</u> clickable links on each record in the list results. The reference number (Ref) and the name of the contact at the organisation (Contact). You access the volunteer registration by clicking on the **Reg** number (Highlighted below). Clicking on the Contact will take you to the contact record itself.

So to view the interaction record, simply click on the reference number.


<a href="#top">Back to Top.</a>

**Navigate to an interaction with a contact (including volunteers)** <a name="incvol"></a>

Click on the Contact tab and navigate to the contact you are interested in, either by using the global search or a view.

Click into the Contact view. To see if there are any interactions, either scroll to the bottom of the page to view associated entities, or look at over the Interactions link at the top of the page. If the number in brackets is not 0, there are associated interactions.

n.b. whether you are looking for an interaction with an individual contact not representing an organisation or a volunteer, the interaction will always be with the contact record, not the volunteer registration. If you wish to view interactions with a volunteer, click on Contact Name within the volunteer registration to go to the contact record.
