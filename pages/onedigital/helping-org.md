## I want to help my organisation to make more use of digital

We know that 50% of charities struggle with basic digital skills. This can make it difficult to communicate, fundraise and meet the expectation of users.

We run a programme of free of charge training and events. From September we will be supporting a series of ‘<strong>meetups</strong>’ across the country.

If you come along to a meetup you will find a friendly and welcoming atmosphere, designed for people who are interested but not necessarily experienced with technology. Local organisations will talk about their successes and challenges in a particular area, for example using social media. There will be lots of space to talk and network, and learn from others in the room.

"One Digital meetups are a great opportunity to hear from experts in their fields about how we, as non-profits, can better utilise digital resources. It's also a chance to meet up with other professionals and share information and ideas.”

If you have never been to a meetup before don’t worry - we would love to have you along. [Click here](http://www.meetup.com/One-Digital-Meetup/) to find out where and when your closest meetup is taking place.

## Training

If you feel your organisation would benefit from training to better understand the potential for digital then we might be able to help. We have been working in partnership with the network of Third Sector Interfaces to roll out a training programme called Making Digital Work.

This course has been delivered to over 200 organisations, with over 90% satisfaction rates.

“Course was great! Staff very friendly and informative. Explained new concepts thoroughly and answered any questions. Thank you!”

      Managers at a care organisation feel that their current way of recording home visits on paper forms is labour-intensive. This training could mean that a real-time, electronic reporting system could be considered and care workers could update information remotely in one go.</p>
