The team at Skyscanner are offering a <strong>one day free masterclass</strong> on October 7th for up to 10 charities. The day will focus on how charities can help their supporters and users to find their information, using messenger apps - like Facebook or WhatsApp.

If you work for a charity that deals with a lot of customer service queries, or run an information and advice service then this event is for you. The Skyscanner team will work with you to understand your current processes, and the sorts of queries you receive. They will build you a ‘bot’ to test out whether you can automate some of the more simple responses, leaving you more time to deal with complex queries.

David Low from Skyscanner explains more about what a bot is, and how it could help:

## Skyscanner / SCVO Messaging Masterclass

Thirty years ago if you wanted to speak to someone you would pick up the phone. In 2016, many of us are more likely to send a message.

Apps and services like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Skype are dominating our lives. In a recent report, eight out of the most popular ten apps in the world were "chat" apps of one kind or another.

This has led to a revolution over the past year. People now use these apps to get in touch with organisations, as well as friends.

Charities have started to experiment, engaging with supporters and users via different social media channels and apps. For example, See Me Scotland launched their #myunfilteredlife campaign on Instagram.

The trouble is that this kind of communication is time consuming, and it can be difficult to respond to queries outside office hours. One option is to automate some of the responses, to save time and extend the hours when people can get support.

Understandably there is a worry that this could water down services, making the charity feel less friendly and less 'human'.

And that, in the last nine - ten months, has really driven the rise of 'bots'.

Bots are effectively a way to get around this problem of making an automated service that bit more 'human'. Nobody likes sitting on the phone going through "press 1 for help, press 2 if you want us to hang up" - and by the same token, nobody will use an advice service which appears to spit out repetitive, stale answers from a script.

Some new services such as Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana, are taking this a step further by actively adding a voice to the conversation, and as the years go by, these voices sound more and more authentic.

At Skyscanner we have spent the last year crafting both our response to this, and some products that get over these problems. We developed a flight search 'bot' which, once users get over the initial hurdle of "I'm talking to a robot", can find a flight with one short typed sentence, rather than 10-12 clicks, taps and types into a web site or an app.

But beyond that, we think hard about how people react to this type of service, and how to conduct 'dialogue' in a way that doesn't put them off, gets the right next question, and doesn't appear unfriendly.

We call it "a little more conversation, a little less action".

Some charities have started to experiment with bots for some of their services. They could lend themselves to customer service processes and simple information queries. Shelter Scotland recently took part in a hackathon day where they developed a bot called ‘Sheldon’ to help people with queries about renting. You can read more about it [here](https://chatbotsmagazine.com/meet-sheldon-the-housing-charity-bot-fa30f50dafe7#.kek8v1lyb)

The Skyscanner team would like to help other charities to start their journey to develop bots that will help to get users and supporters to the answers they need more quickly.

To make the most of the day, we'd need you to bring these things:

* Think about your own 'dialogue' - and work backwards. Think of the things you are able to tell people, and work back towards the kind of questions they'd ask to find it.

* Think about any other products you have - for example a web site or printed literature - and how people use that. Look at those and think how a spoken conversation would work, to deliver the same information.

* Have an open mind on this type of service and the power it can bring even to the simplest form of communication.

* We'll be on hand to answer questions and guide you through it.

If you are interested in taking up one of the places please email [jo.malo@scvo.org.uk](mailto:jo.malo@scvo.org.uk) with a brief outline of what your organisation does, and how you think this masterclass will help you.
